Methods: A systematic review was conducted of research published utilising the MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycInfo, CINAHL and SocIndex databases from inception to March 2015. A meta-analysis was performed on studies that met the inclusion criteria, to determine if there were any significant pre- and post-intervention effects on alcohol-use. Results: Seventeen studies from three continents were included in this systematic review. A meta-analysis of pre- and post-intervention effects on alcohol use across the 17 studies found highly significant effects (p < 0.001). A smaller subset of studies (n = 10), where the same specific alcohol use outcome measurement was employed across all studies, also showed highly significant pre-post intervention effects (p < 0.001). Results indicate that a range of interventions were effective in reducing alcohol use and abuse within samples of homeless participants, although short-term effects are more apparent than longer term ones. Conclusions: There is a relative paucity of research into alcohol abusing homeless adults, which has implications for evidence-based practice. This systematic meta-analytical review demonstrates that a range of alcohol abuse interventions for homeless adults produces improvements in alcohol use (p < 0.001).

This study compared the impact of current practice of hostel staff encouraging MXU screening for TB among homeless people with the addition of peer educators with direct experience of TB and/or homelessness on screening uptake. Design/methods Between February 2012 and October 2013 London homeless hostels accessing MXU TB screening were randomised to intervention or control arms by minimisation, balancing on hostel size (<43 beds), and previous screening uptake level (<50%). Sites with a previous MXU uptake of >80% were excluded. At intervention sites, peers worked with hostel staff to encourage screening (through contacting and speaking with residents). The primary outcome was the proportion of eligible residents screened for TB. Blinding of participants and observers was not possible due to the nature of the intervention. Analysis was performed by intention to treat (ITT). Results Of 59 hostels considered for eligibility, 46 were randomised (24 allocated to the control and 22 to the intervention arm - Figure 1). Across all sites, median uptake was 44% (IQR: 26,59). Control hostels had a total of 1192 residents [median uptake 45%, (IQR: 33,55)]. Intervention sites had 1150 residents [median uptake 40%, (IQR: 25,61)]. Using Poisson regression to account for the clustered study design, size of hostel, and previous screening uptake, there was no evidence for peer educators increasing uptake of screening - adjusted risk ratio 0.98% (95% CIs: 0.80,1.20). Conclusion This study found no evidence for peer educators increasing the uptake of MXU TB screening. The wide confidence intervals associated with this result mean that we may be missing a 20% effect, which could be explained by a pragmatic study design where sites were not naive to the intervention as peers had previously been involved in screening sessions at many hostels.

A systematic and comprehensive international review on effective interventions for homeless youth is presented. This study seeks to provide an accurate and complete picture of effective interventions for homeless youth by collecting, summarizing, categorizing, and evaluating quantitative studies (i.e., those that have assessed treatment outcomes). Evidence acquistion: The following databases were searched in 2008: PsycINFO, ERIC, MEDLINE, and Cochrane were searched from 1985 through 2008 using specifıc key words: interventions and programs, with homeless youth (s), homeless adolescents, street youth (s), runaways and throwaways. In addition, references of key articles were searched by hand. Eleven studies met preestablished inclusion criteria. To determine study quality, a set of operational parameters was formulated to rate each study as either good, fair, or poor. Evidence synthesis: There is no compelling evidence that specifıc interventions are effective for homeless youth, owing to moderate study quality and the small number of intervention studies. Conclusions that can be drawn from the studies are limited by the heterogeneity of interventions, participants, methods, and outcome measures. Many interventions focused on reduction of substance abuse, whereas other important outcomes, such as quality of life, have received little attention. No study received a quality rating of good, and four studies were rated as fair. Most convincing, but still marginal, were results of interventions based on cognitive– behavioral approaches, which revealed some positive results on psychological measures. Conclusions: More methodologically sound research is needed to determine what specifıc interventions are benefıcial for subgroups of homeless youth. Implications for future research are discussed.","outcomes":["Capabilities and Wellbeing","Crime and justice","Employment and income","Health","Housing stability"],"city":"Halifax","status":"Completed","countryX":"Canada","countryY":"Canada","stateX":"","stateY":"","quality":"Low quality reviews"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-63.575","44.6484"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"E-4","type":"Effectiveness","studyDesign":"Before versus after design","studyType":"Impact evaluations","title":"Housing First for Severely Mentally Ill Homeless Methadone Patients","year":"2012","url":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10550887.2012.694602","authors":"Appel P W; Tsemberis S ; Joseph H ; Stefancic A ; Lambert-Wacey D ;","interventionCategories":["Services and outreach","Accommodation and accommodation-based services","Health and social care"],"populationGroups":["People with/history of mental illness"],"abstract":"The Housing First approach used by Pathways to Housing, Inc., was used to enhance residential independence and treatment retention of homeless, seriously mentally ill methadone patients.

Homeless adults with a diagnosed major mental health disorder were recruited through community agencies and randomised to HF (n = 1265) and TAU (n = 990). HF participants were provided with private housing units and received case management support services. TAU participants retained access to existing community supports. Past-month suicidal ideation was measured at baseline and 6, 12, 18, and 21/24 months. A history of suicide attempts was measured at baseline and the 21/24-month follow-up. Results: Compared to baseline, there was an overall trend of decreased past-month suicidal ideation (estimate = –.57, SE = .05, P < 0.001), with no effect of treatment group (i.e., HF vs. TAU; estimate = –.04, SE = .06, P = 0.51).

Conclusion: This study failed to find evidence that HF is superior to TAU in reducing suicidal ideation and attempts. We suggest that HF interventions consider supplemental psychological treatments that have proven efficacy in reducing suicidal behaviour. It remains to be determined what kind of suicide prevention interventions (if any) are specifically effective in further reducing suicidal risk in a housing-first intervention.","outcomes":["Health"],"city":"Vancouver","status":"Completed","countryX":"Canada","countryY":"Canada","stateX":"","stateY":"","quality":"Low quality primary studies"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-123.1139","49.2609"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"E-6","type":"Effectiveness","studyDesign":"Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs)","studyType":"Impact evaluations","title":"The Stepped Care Intervention to Suppress Viral Load in Youth Living With HIV: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial","year":"2019","url":"https://www.researchprotocols.org/2019/2/e10791/?utm_source=TrendMD&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=JMIR_TrendMD_0","authors":"Arnold E M; Swendeman D ; Harris D ; Fournier J ; Kozina L ; Abdalian S ; Rotheram M J;","interventionCategories":["Health and social care"],"populationGroups":["Young people","HIV patients"],"abstract":"BACKGROUND: Among youth living with HIV (YLH) aged 12-24 years who have health care in the United States, only 30% to 40% are virally suppressed. YLH must achieve viral suppression in order to reduce the probability of infecting others as well as increasing the length and quality of their own life. OBJECTIVE: This randomized controlled trial aimed to evaluate the efficacy of an Enhanced Standard Care condition (n=110) compared to an Enhanced Stepped Care intervention condition (n=110) to increase viral suppression among YLH aged 12-24 years with established infection (not acutely infected). METHODS: YLH (N=220) who are not virally suppressed will be identified at homeless shelters, health clinics, and gay-identified community-based organizations in Los Angeles, CA, and New Orleans, LA. Informed consent will be obtained from all participants. YLH will be randomly assigned to one of two study conditions: Enhanced Standard Care, which includes standard clinical care plus an automated messaging and monitoring intervention (AMMI), or an Enhanced Stepped Care, which includes three levels of intervention (AMMI, Peer Support via social media plus AMMI, or Coaching plus Peer Support and AMMI). The primary outcome is viral suppression of HIV, and YLH will be assessed at 4-month intervals for 24 months. For the Enhanced Stepped Care intervention group, those who do not achieve viral suppression (via blood draw, viral load<200 copies/mL) at any 4-month assessment will \"step up\" to the next level of intervention. Secondary outcomes will be retention in care, antiretroviral therapy adherence, alcohol use, substance use, sexual behavior, and mental health symptoms. RESULTS: Recruitment for this study began in June 2017 and is ongoing. We estimate data collection to be completed by the end of 2020. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first known application of an Enhanced Stepped Care intervention model for YLH. By providing the lowest level of intervention needed to achieve viral suppression, this model has the potential to be a cost-effective method of helping YLH achieve viral suppression and improve their quality of life.

It is also expensive. Individuals experiencing chronic homelessness suffer disproportionately from serious physical and mental health conditions and are less likely than the general population to seek services to address these conditions. For these reasons, chronically homeless individuals are often repeat users of emergency services — including medical, law-enforcement, and paramedic-response services. This pattern of service use is costly for cities in terms of both dollars and manpower. Assertive community treatment — an approach to homelessness that gets people into affordable housing and provides health care and other support services — can reduce public costs associated with chronic homelessness. In 2016, the City of Santa Monica invested $600,000 into such an approach, creating the Homeless Multidisciplinary Street Team (HMST). The HMST consists of a team of specialists who locate and engage the most-intensive service users among Santa Monica's homeless individuals to help them obtain housing and address other needs. The program aims to reduce the burden on public service providers and diminish associated public costs by lessening the number of times that homeless individuals use public services and interact with public service providers, including police and emergency medical responders. RAND researchers evaluated the program's success in achieving its goals. They used a mixed methods approach that combined a qualitative analysis of the effect of the HMST on important stakeholder groups and a quantitative analysis both of the effect of the HMST on important outcomes and on potential cost savings associated with these effects.","outcomes":["Cost","Crime and justice","Health"],"city":"Sacramento","status":"Completed","countryX":"United States","countryY":"United States","stateX":"California","stateY":"California","quality":"Low quality primary studies"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-121.494444","38.581667"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"E-8","type":"Effectiveness","studyDesign":"Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs)","studyType":"Impact evaluations","title":"A randomized controlled trial of the effectiveness of Housing First in a small Canadian City","year":"2019","url":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12889-019-7492-8","authors":"Aubry T ; Bourque J ; Goering P ; Crouse S ; Veldhuizen S ; LeBlanc S ; Cherner R ; Bourque P É; Pakzad S ; Bradshaw C ;","interventionCategories":["Services and outreach","Accommodation and accommodation-based services","Health and social care"],"populationGroups":["People with/history of mental illness"],"abstract":"BACKGROUND: The paper presents two-year findings from a study investigating the effectiveness of Housing First (HF) with assertive community treatment (ACT) in helping individuals with serious mental illness, who are homeless or precariously housed and living in a small city, to become stably housed. METHODS: The research design was a parallel group non-blinded RCT with participants randomly assigned after the baseline interview to receive HF with ACT (N = 100) or treatment as usual (TAU; N = 101). Participants were interviewed every 3 months over 21/24 months to investigate changes on a range of housing and psychosocial outcomes. The primary outcomes were housing stability (as defined by a joint function of number of days housed and number of moves) and improvement in community functioning. Secondary predicted outcomes were improvements in self-rated physical and mental health status, substance use problems, quality of life, community integration, and recovery. RESULTS: An intent-to-treat analysis was conducted. Compared to TAU participants, HF participants who entered housing did so more quickly (23.30 versus 88.25 days, d = 1.02, 95% CI [0.50-1.53], p < 0.001), spent a greater proportion of time stably housed (Z = 5.30, p < 0.001, OR = 3.12, 95% CI [1.96-4.27]), and rated the quality of their housing more positively (Z = 4.59, p < 0.001, d = 0.43, 95% CI [0.25-0.62]). HF participants were also more likely to be housed continually in the final 6 months (i.e., 79.57% vs. 55.47%), chi2 (2, n = 170) = 11.46, p = .003, Cramer's V = 0.26, 95% CI [0.14-0.42]). HF participants showed greater gains in quality of life, (Z = 3.83, p < 0.001, ASMD = 0.50, 95% CI [0.24-0.75]), psychological integration (Z = 12.89, p < 0.001, pooled ASMD = 0.91, 95% CI [0.77-1.05]), and perceived recovery (Z = 2.26, p = 0.03, ASMD = 0.39, 95% CI [0.05-0.74]) than TAU participants. CONCLUSIONS: The study indicates that HF ends homelessness significantly more rapidly than TAU for a majority of individuals with serious mental illness who have a history of homelessness and live in a small city. In addition, compared to TAU, HF produces psychosocial benefits for its recipients that include an enhanced quality of life, a greater sense of belonging in the community, and greater improvements in perceived recovery from mental illness.

Patient navigation is a strategy for guiding individuals through complex health systems, and we hypothesize that this may be a promising approach for helping homeless-experienced people overcome their unique barriers to obtaining LCS. We will aim to recruit 300 people to participate in this research study; 100 will be randomly assigned to arm 1 (usual care) and 200 will be randomly assigned to arm 2 (patient navigation). Randomization of participants will be stratified by smoking status, housing status, clinical site, and whether they have previously discussed LCS with their primary care provider (PCP) to ensure balance between study groups on these variables. People assigned to the usual care arm will be referred back to their PCP for further management. People assigned to the patient navigation arm will be given the chance to work with a LCS navigator. The navigator will assist participants and their PCPs with all aspects of the LCS process in addition to offering brief tobacco counseling for current smokers. The primary aim of the trial is to determine—among homeless-experienced people who are eligible for LCS—the effect of patient navigation on 1) LCS LDCT completion at 6 months post-enrollment and 2) LCS LDCT completion at 6 months with diagnostic follow-up of abnormal results within 1 month of the recommended time frame. Study outcomes will be assessed by examining participant health records. Following the intervention, qualitative interviews will be conducted with 40 participants and 10 BHCHP PCPs to better understand how the LCS process unfolds in the setting of homelessness, the ways in which the navigator facilitated this process, and opportunities for improving the navigation intervention for future use","outcomes":["Health"],"city":"Boston","status":"Ongoing","countryX":"United States","countryY":"United States","stateX":"Massachusets","stateY":"Massachusets","quality":"Ongoing"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-71.063611","42.358056"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"E-14","type":"Effectiveness","studyDesign":"Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs)","studyType":"Impact evaluations","title":"Financial incentives for smoking abstinence in homeless smokers: a randomized controlled trial","year":"2017","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/ntr/ntx178","authors":"Baggett T P; Chang Y ; Yaqubi A ; McGlave C ; Higgins S T; Rigotti N A;","interventionCategories":["Services and outreach","Health and social care"],"populationGroups":["People with alcohol/drug issues"],"abstract":"Introduction: Three-quarters of homeless people smoke cigarettes. Financial incentives for smoking abstinence have appeared promising in nonexperimental studies of homeless smokers, but randomized controlled trial (RCT) data are lacking. Methods: We conducted a pilot RCT of financial incentives for homeless smokers. Incentive arm participants (N = 25) could earn escalating $15–$35 rewards for brief smoking abstinence (exhaled carbon monoxide <8 parts per million) assessed 14 times over 8 weeks. Control arm participants (N = 25) were given $10 at each assessment regardless of abstinence. All participants were offered nicotine patches and counseling. The primary outcome was a repeated measure of brief smoking abstinence across 14 assessments. The secondary outcome was brief abstinence at 8 weeks. Exploratory outcomes were self-reported 1-day and 7-day abstinence from (1) any cigarette and (2) any puff of a cigarette. Other outcomes included 24-hour quit attempts, nicotine patch use, counseling attendance, and changes in alcohol and drug use. Results:Compared to control, incentive arm participants were more likely to achieve brief abstinence overall (odds ratio 7.28, 95% confidence interval 2.89 to 18.3) and at 8 weeks (48% vs. 8%, p = .004). Similar effects were seen for 1-day abstinence, but 7-day puff abstinence was negligible in both arms. Incentive arm participants made more quit attempts (p = .03). Nicotine patch use and counseling attendance were not significantly different between the groups. Alcohol and drug use did not change significantly in either group. Conclusions: Among homeless smokers, financial incentives increased brief smoking abstinence and quit attempts without worsening substance use. This approach merits further development focused on promoting sustained abstinence.","outcomes":["Cost","Health"],"city":"Boston","status":"Completed","countryX":"United States","countryY":"United States","stateX":"Massachusets","stateY":"Massachusets","quality":"High quality primary studies"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-71.063611","42.358056"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"E-15","type":"Effectiveness","studyDesign":"Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs)","studyType":"Impact evaluations","title":"SmokefreeTXT for Homeless Smokers: Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial","year":"2019","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6746087/","authors":"Baggett T P; McGlave C ; Kruse G R; Yaqubi A ; Chang Y ; Rigotti N A;","interventionCategories":["Health and social care"],"populationGroups":["People with alcohol/drug issues"],"abstract":"Background: Homeless smokers want to quit smoking but face numerous barriers to doing so, including pervasive smoking among peers and a lack of social support for quitting. An SMS (short message service) text messaging intervention could address these challenges by providing virtual daily support for homeless smokers who are trying to quit but coping with multiple triggers to smoke. Objective: This study aimed to assess whether a free SMS text messaging program, added to evidence-based pharmacotherapy and counseling, improved smoking abstinence among homeless adult smokers. Methods: From October 2015 to June 2016, we conducted an 8-week pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) of nicotine patch therapy and weekly in-person counseling with (n=25) or without (n=25) SmokefreeTXT, a free SMS text messaging service administered by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) at Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program. All participants were provided with a mobile phone and a 2-month prepaid voice and text plan at no cost. SmokefreeTXT enrollees were sent 1 to 5 automated SMS text messages daily for up to 8 weeks and could receive on-demand tips for managing cravings, mood symptoms, and smoking lapses. The primary outcome was smoking abstinence, defined as an exhaled carbon monoxide count of <8 parts per million, assessed 14 times over 8 weeks of follow-up, and analyzed using repeated-measures logistic regression with generalized estimating equations. Other outcomes were use of SmokefreeTXT, assessed by data obtained from NCI; perceptions of SmokefreeTXT, assessed by surveys and qualitative interviews; and mobile phone retention, assessed by self-report. Results: Of the SmokefreeTXT arm participants (n=25), 88% (22) enrolled in the program, but only 56% (14) had confirmed enrollment for >= 2 weeks. Among 2-week enrollees, the median response rate to interactive messages from SmokefreeTXT was 2.1% (interquartile range 0-10.5%). Across all time points, smoking abstinence did not differ significantly between SmokefreeTXT and control arm participants (odds ratio 0.92, 95% CI 0.30-2.84). Of SmokefreeTXT enrollees who completed exit surveys (n=15), two-thirds were very or extremely satisfied with the program. However, qualitative interviews (n=14) revealed that many participants preferred in-person intervention formats over phone-based, found the SMS text messages impersonal and robotic, and felt that the messages were too frequent and repetitive. Only 40% (10/25) of SmokefreeTXT arm participants retained their study-supplied mobile phone for the 8-week duration of the trial, with phone theft being common. Storing and charging phones were cited as challenges. Conclusions: SmokefreeTXT, added to nicotine patch therapy and in-person counseling, did not significantly improve smoking abstinence in this 8-week pilot RCT for homeless smokers. SMS text messaging interventions for this population should be better tuned to the unique circumstances of homelessness and coupled with efforts to promote mobile phone retention over time.","outcomes":["Health"],"city":"Boston","status":"Completed","countryX":"United States","countryY":"United States","stateX":"Massachusets","stateY":"Massachusets","quality":"Medium quality primary studies"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-71.063611","42.358056"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"E-16","type":"Effectiveness","studyDesign":"Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs)","studyType":"Impact evaluations","title":"Subsistence difficulties are associated with more barriers to quitting and worse abstinence outcomes among homeless smokers: evidence from two studies in Boston, Massachusetts","year":"2018","url":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12889-018-5375-z","authors":"Baggett T P; Yaqubi A ; Berkowitz S A; Kalkhoran S M; McGlave C ; Chang Y ; Campbell E G; Rigotti N A;","interventionCategories":["Health and social care"],"populationGroups":["People with alcohol/drug issues"],"abstract":"BACKGROUND: Three-quarters of homeless people smoke cigarettes. Competing priorities for shelter, food, and other subsistence needs may be one explanation for low smoking cessation rates in this population. We analyzed data from two samples of homeless smokers to examine the associations between subsistence difficulties and 1) smoking cessation readiness, confidence, and barriers in a cross-sectional study, and 2) smoking abstinence during follow-up in a longitudinal study. METHODS: We conducted a survey of homeless smokers (N = 306) in 4/2014-7/2014 and a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) for homeless smokers (N = 75) in 10/2015-6/2016 at Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program. In both studies, subsistence difficulties were characterized as none, low, or high based on responses to a 5-item scale assessing the frequency of past-month difficulty finding shelter, food, clothing, a place to wash, and a place to go to the bathroom. Among survey participants, we used linear regression to assess the associations between subsistence difficulty level and readiness to quit, confidence to quit, and a composite measure of perceived barriers to quitting. Among RCT participants, we used repeated-measures logistic regression to examine the association between baseline subsistence difficulty level and carbon monoxide-defined brief smoking abstinence assessed 14 times over 8 weeks of follow-up. Analyses adjusted for demographic characteristics, substance use, mental illness, and nicotine dependence. RESULTS: Subsistence difficulties were common in both study samples. Among survey participants, greater subsistence difficulties were associated with more perceived barriers to quitting (p < 0.001) but not with cessation readiness or confidence. A dose-response relationship was observed for most barriers, particularly psychosocial barriers. Among RCT participants, greater baseline subsistence difficulties predicted less smoking abstinence during follow-up in a dose-response fashion. In adjusted analyses, individuals with the highest level of subsistence difficulty had one-third the odds of being abstinent during follow-up compared to those without subsistence difficulties (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.11-0.93) despite making a similar number of quit attempts. CONCLUSIONS: Homeless smokers with greater subsistence difficulties perceive more barriers to quitting and are less likely to do so despite similar readiness, confidence, and attempts. Future studies should assess whether addressing subsistence difficulties improves cessation outcomes in this population.

Data were available for analysis for the years 2008 to 2010. DESIGN: The SPC was developed, managed, and staffed by board-certified psychiatric/mental health nurse practitioners, offering comprehensive mental health services and coordinated interventions. RESULTS: All clients were housed and none incarcerated. From 2008 to 2010, only 3% of clients were hospitalized, compared with 7.5% of adults with SMI.

A research gap exists in the literature on homelessness and counseling outcomes. Accordingly, this researcher investigated the effect of outreach counseling services provided by the Community Based Counseling Program (CBCP) to homeless individuals currently living in shelters and transitional housing units. The premise of this research study was that homeless individuals who participated in outreach counseling services would report decreased problem severity on the ASI in seven domains: medical, employment, drug, alcohol, legal, social, and psychiatric. A quasi-experimental research design was used. Subjects consisted of 67 homeless men and women; 31 subjects were in the treatment group and 36 subjects were in the comparison group. The treatment group composition was mainly female while the comparison group composition was mainly male. The treatment group received a pretest and posttest ASI and outreach counseling services. The comparison group received a pretest and posttest ASI and did not receive counseling services during the study. In addition, post-intervention ASI scores were examined after demographic factors such as gender, ethnicity, and age were taken into account. The ASI was utilized to measure change scores between the treatment and comparison groups. The dependent variables were the post-ASI difference scores in medical, employment, drug, alcohol, legal, social, and psychiatric domains. The independent variable was the counseling intervention. Data were analyzed using a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results from this study indicated significant differences between the treatment and comparison groups on pretest and posttest ASI social and psychiatric scores. There were non-significant changes between the treatment and comparison groups on posttest ASI medical, alcohol, drug, and legal scores. A significant correlation between employment status and age existed, with younger clients reporting greater change post-counseling than their older counterparts. Because there were differences between the groups initially with regard to gender, it was impossible to determine whether the findings were due to treatment effects or gender differences. The researcher concluded that outreach counseling contributed to measurable change in a homeless population. It is hoped that the results of this study will stimulate further investigations in the under-researched area of homelessness and counseling outcomes.

Homelessness services utilise peers to engage this population in the UK, but with little evidence. Current definitions are too broad and lack differentiation between types of peer support. Therefore, there is a need to clarify underlying concepts within peer interventions to influence practice and for future research. This thesis aims to identify and define the underlying change mechanisms involved in peer interventions for those who are homeless and the feasibility of testing the effectiveness of this intervention. Using the Medical Research Council guidance on developing complex interventions, two literature reviews and three empirical studies were completed. Chapter 3 reports a review of the literature exploring the effectiveness of peer interventions and evaluates included articles for potential common elements in peer interventions, from 13 articles. Chapter 4 describes qualitative interviews with 29 participants providing and/or receiving this support to understand potential change mechanisms. Interestingly, it was found that participants were describing a mentorship-type of peer support, suggesting further clarification is needed. Therefore, a second literature review was conducted, in Chapter 5. This realist review focused on the mentorship-type of peer support, terming it intentional, unidirectional peer support (IUPS). The iterative literature search resulted in 71 articles from several sources (e.g. empirical and theoretical literature). Chapter 5 provides a detailed description of IUPS from multiple health areas and suggests change mechanisms that can transcend contexts. To test these concepts in a homeless context, Chapter 6 reports a Q Sort study; a mixed methods design that has never been used within this topic, where a by-person approach to factor analysis is used to generate understanding of shared viewpoints. Forty participants (20 peers and 20 professionals) involved in the delivery and/or facilitation of peer interventions for a homeless population were recruited. Peers and professionals ranked general statements describing peer interventions. Results found support for the developed change mechanisms in Chapter 5 and further evidence the need for peer interventions to be clearly defined in practice and research. To aid this, Chapter 7 reports IUPS as an evidence-based intervention that can be used to inform practice and future research. Additionally, this intervention definition was utilised in the final empirical study in Chapter 8, where the feasibility of testing IUPS across multiple homeless organisations through a controlled cohort study was conducted. Five organisations (two in treatment group and three in control group) participated. Through qualitative interviews and quantitative data, a number of recommendations are suggested to ensure the success of future research. The work in this thesis provides an identification of emerging issues within peer interventions that are worthy of investigation, creating new understanding of a previously poorly defined peer intervention. The main contribution of knowledge that this thesis provides is the clarity on types of peer interventions, and illuminates new avenues to further our understanding of this important topic.","outcomes":["Capabilities and Wellbeing","Crime and justice","Employment and income","Health","Housing stability"],"city":"New York","status":"Completed","countryX":"United States","countryY":"United States","stateX":"New York","stateY":"New York","quality":"Low quality reviews"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-73.9808","40.7648"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"E-21","type":"Effectiveness","studyDesign":"Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs)","studyType":"Impact evaluations","title":"The utility of mentoring homeless adolescents: a pilot study","year":"2012","url":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/00952990.2011.643985","authors":"Bartle-Haring S ; Slesnick N ; Collins J ; Erdem G ; Buettner C ;","interventionCategories":["Employment","Health and social care"],"populationGroups":["People with alcohol/drug issues"],"abstract":"Background: Despite the intuitive appeal and popularity of mentoring programs, mentoring has shown only limited success for positively impacting children's psychosocial functioning. Furthermore, we were not able to identify a study that examined the potential utility of mentoring for homeless adolescents. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this pilot study was to examine the impact of mentoring among a group of homeless adolescents who were also receiving substance abuse treatment. Methods: This pilot study examined the impact of mentoring among homeless adolescents (n = 90) between the ages of 14 and 20 years who also received substance abuse treatment. A longitudinal design was used in which adolescents were assessed at baseline, 3 months, and following the completion of treatment at 6 months postbaseline. Results: Findings showed that adolescents with a history of physical or sexual abuse attended more mentoring sessions. Also, mentoring in addition to treatment was associated with a decrease in problem consequences associated with substance use. However, more mentoring with fewer treatment sessions was associated with an increase in internalizing behaviors. Only these two outcomes were associated with mentoring. Conclusions and Scientific Significance: While not providing resounding support for mentoring, this study suggests that examining the mentor/mentee relationship may be a fruitful line of future research given that significant variability among the mentor/mentee pairs was noted for some outcomes of interest.","outcomes":["Health"],"city":"Columbus","status":"Completed","countryX":"United States","countryY":"United States","stateX":"Ohio","stateY":"Ohio","quality":"Low quality primary studies"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-83.000556","39.962222"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"E-22","type":"Effectiveness","studyDesign":"Systematic reviews","studyType":"Systematic reviews","title":"The effectiveness of housing interventions and housing and service interventions on ending family homelessness: A systematic review","year":"2014","url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/ort0000020","authors":"Bassuk E L; DeCandia C J; Tsertsvadze A ; Richard M K;","interventionCategories":["Services and outreach","Accommodation and accommodation-based services"],"populationGroups":["Families with children"],"abstract":"Family homelessness has become a growing public health problem over the last 3 decades.

Overall, there was some postintervention improvement in housing and employment, but ongoing residential and work stability were not achieved. Methodological limitations, poor reporting quality, and inconsistent definitions across outcomes hindered between-study comparisons. Substantial limitations in research underscore the insufficiency of our current knowledge base for ending homelessness. Although many families were no longer literally homeless, long-term residential stability and employment at a livable wage were not ensured.

A policy approach aiming to end homelessness across Europe and North America, the Housing First’ (HF) model, provides rapid housing, not conditional on abstinence from substance use. We aimed to systematically review the evidence from randomised controlled trials for the effects of HF on health and well-being. Methods We searched seven databases for randomised controlled trials of interventions providing rapid access to non-abstinence-contingent, permanent housing. We extracted data on the following outcomes: mental health; self-reported health and quality of life; substance use; non-routine use of healthcare services; housing stability. We assessed risk of bias and calculated standardised effect sizes. Results We included four studies, all with ‘high’ risk of bias. The impact of HF on most short-term health outcomes was imprecisely estimated, with varying effect directions. No clear difference in substance use was seen. Intervention groups experienced fewer emergency department visits (incidence rate ratio (IRR)=0.63; 95% CI 0.48 to 0.82), fewer hospitalisations (IRR=0.76; 95% CI 0.70 to 0.83) and less time spent hospitalised (standardised mean difference (SMD)=−0.14; 95% CI −0.41 to 0.14) than control groups.

Conclusion HF approaches successfully improve housing stability and may improve some aspects of health. Implementation of HF would likely reduce homelessness and non-routine health service use without an increase in problematic substance use.

Housed PWID were also less likely to achieve cure (OR = 0.37, 95% CI 0.20-0.67; P = .001). Cure rates did not differ in patients not lost to follow-up. OPAT can be effective in PWID and the homeless, but loss to follow-up is a significant barrier.","outcomes":["Health"],"city":"Seattle","status":"Completed","countryX":"United States","countryY":"United States","stateX":"Washington","stateY":"Washington","quality":"Low quality primary studies"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-122.3301","47.6038"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"E-29","type":"Effectiveness","studyDesign":"Non-experimental design with comparison group","studyType":"Impact evaluations","title":"Hepatitis C treatment outcomes among homeless-experienced individuals at a community health centre in Boston","year":"2019","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0955395919300799","authors":"Beiser M E; Smith K ; Ingemi M ; Mulligan E ; Baggett T P;","interventionCategories":["Health and social care"],"populationGroups":["People with existing health conditions (excluding HIV)"],"abstract":"BACKGROUND: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection prevalence is high among adults who experience homelessness but data on HCV treatment outcomes are limited in this population. We examined HCV treatment engagement and outcomes in a cohort of homeless-experienced adults treated through an innovative community-based primary care program in Boston, Massachusetts, USA. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of individuals referred for HCV treatment at Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program (BHCHP) from January 2014 to March 2017. We assessed HCV treatment initiation, treatment completion, sustained virologic response (SVR), and reinfection rates. We conducted univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses to examine the predictors of these outcomes. RESULTS: Of 510 referred for HCV treatment, 210 (41.1%) did not initiate treatment, principally because of being lost to follow-up (N = 93) or having superseding social issues (N = 49). Of 300 who initiated treatment, 80% were male, 52.3% were non-white, and 29% were homeless. Over half (58.6%) had a history of opioid use disorder (OUD). Twenty percent had cirrhosis. Treatment was completed by 285 (95.0%) individuals, and 255 (85.0%) achieved SVR. In multivariable analyses, individuals with bipolar disorder (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.15-0.99), treated (OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.14-0.96) or untreated (OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.05-0.57) OUD, or on-treatment insurance change (OR 0.16, 95% CI 0.04-0.67) were less likely to achieve SVR, while individuals living with HIV (OR 10.43, 95% CI 1.33-81.96) were more likely to achieve SVR. Among 126 individuals with post-SVR follow-up data, 27 reinfections were identified during 206 person-years of follow up (rate 13.1 per 100 person-years). CONCLUSION: Homeless-experienced individuals initiating HCV treatment in a community-based program achieved high rates of treatment completion and SVR, but a large proportion did not initiate treatment. Individuals with OUD experienced lower but still substantial rates of cure. Treatment strategies targeting homeless-experienced people should focus on improving initial engagement and minimizing reinfection risk following treatment.","outcomes":["Health"],"city":"Boston","status":"Completed","countryX":"United States","countryY":"United States","stateX":"Massachusets","stateY":"Massachusets","quality":"Low quality primary studies"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-71.063611","42.358056"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"E-30","type":"Effectiveness","studyDesign":"Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs)","studyType":"Impact evaluations","title":"A randomized controlled trial of intensive care management for disabled Medicaid beneficiaries with high health care costs","year":"2015","url":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1475-6773.12258","authors":"Bell J F; Krupski A ; Joesch J M; West I I; Atkins D C; Court B ; Mancuso D ; Roy‐Byrne P ;","interventionCategories":["Services and outreach","Health and social care","Education and skills"],"populationGroups":["People with disabilities"],"abstract":"Objective: To evaluate outcomes of a registered nurse-led care management intervention for disabled Medicaid beneficiaries with high health care costs.

Principal Findings: In the intent-to-treat analysis, the intervention group had higher odds of outpatient mental health service use and higher prescription drug costs than controls in the postperiod. In the subanalysis, participants had fewer unplanned hospital admissions and lower associated costs; higher prescription drug costs; higher odds of long-term care service use; higher drug/alcohol treatment costs; and lower odds of homelessness. Conclusions: We found no health care cost savings for disabled Medicaid beneficiaries randomized to intensive care management. Among participants, care management may have the potential to increase access to needed care, slow growth in the number and therefore cost of unplanned hospitalizations, and prevent homelessness.

Methods: Using a randomized experimental design, the current study pilot tests an intensive (3 day), skill-building intervention to train homeless youth (N = 97, ages 18–21 years) to practice mindfulness and avoid risks. Youths’ mindfulness was assessed via standardized self-report instruments at baseline and post-intervention (1 week post baseline for youth in the control condition). Results: Repeated-measures ANOVA results indicate that although no effect was found on total mindfulness, a significant effect was found for mindfulness subscales. Intervention youth improved in their observation skills significantly more than control youth (F[1] = 3.88, p < .05, partial-η2 = .05). Qualitatively, certain intervention strategies (i.e., facilitating, personal sharing, teaching, and peer activation) demonstrated notable utility in actively engaging youth in mindfulness material, whereas challenges (meeting basic needs, a fight or flight instinct, and a generalized distrust of service providers) created challenges in implementing mindfulness skills.

Methods: The literature search (1980–2013) yielded 14 studies (randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies). Results:The studies found that a majority of participants placed in experimental housing programs with case management support remained in housing for at least one year or experienced more days housed than homeless relative to a comparison group. Although this finding is in line with previous literature reviews on permanent supportive housing, this analysis found limitations in each of the 14 reviewed studies, such as attrition, selection and response bias, imprecise definitions and implementation of housing programs, and a lack of appropriate controls. Only three of the reviewed studies reported using a housing fidelity assessment tool to test whether the housing intervention was faithful to theoretical standards, and conceptions and implementation of housing varied widely across studies, threatening internal and external validity. Conclusions: Pitfalls in the best available studies on permanent supportive housing programs in the United States limit the ability of research to inform the policy goal of ending chronic homelessness and demonstrate a need for further experimental research upon which to make funding and policy decisions, especially in light of prioritized federal funds.","outcomes":["Capabilities and Wellbeing","Health","Housing stability"],"city":"Carson City","status":"Completed","countryX":"United States","countryY":"United States","stateX":"Nevada","stateY":"Nevada","quality":"Low quality reviews"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-119.7674","39.1638"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"E-35","type":"Effectiveness","studyDesign":"Before versus after design","studyType":"Impact evaluations","title":"Health care utilization following a homeless medical respite pilot program","year":"2019","url":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/phn.12589","authors":"Biederman D J; Gamble J ; Wilson S ; Douglas C ; Feigal J ;","interventionCategories":["Prevention","Services and outreach","Health and social care"],"populationGroups":["Discharge from health facilities"],"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate a homeless medical respite pilot program to determine if program participants had health care utilization pattern changes and improved connection to income, housing, and health care resources post program.

The sample consisted of 77 clients with severe and persistent mental illness and a history of homelessness receiving either intensive case management (ICM) or standard care. Costs from the overall societal perspective were calculated by summing the direct and 'hidden' (e.g., travel time) costs associated with: (1) Agency costs (case management services), (2) governmental costs (e.g., non-agency health care costs, non-health care costs), and (3) family/friend costs. Subtracted from this initial total to reach a final societal cost were employment and/or volunteer 'benefits'. Of interest in the study was: (1) Examining the relationship between clients needs at 18 months of a two year trial, global societal costs per client for the six-month period from 18 to 24 months, and 24-month outcomes, and (2) cost-effectiveness of intensive case management over standard care from three costing perspectives (e.g., agency, government, society). Results yielded an overall average comprehensive cost of treatment (both ICM and standard care combined) per client of $57.08/day which is comparable to previous research investigating the costs of community support services. Needs did not predict six month total societal costs; however, receiving ICM and reporting more severe symptomatology predicted higher six-month agency costs. Higher total costs of services and supports predicted poorer housing stability at 24 months for our participants. Higher expenditures related to non-health care costs predicted poorer community ability at 24 months. In general, it seems that higher costs are related to poorer client functioning. Cost-effectiveness analyses revealed that ICM is more cost-effective than standard care from the perspective of the government (i.e., health-related expenses) and society overall, despite agency costs being significantly greater in ICM. Nonparametric bootstrapping methods using net monetary benefit revealed a 0.77 to 0.80 chance of ICM being a cost-effective alternative to standard care. It is clear from this study that increased costs are associated with clients who are doing the poorest in terms of symptoms, housing stability, and community ability. Despite the finding that more intensive treatment does not guarantee better clinical outcomes within our six month window, ICM is shown to be a more cost-effective treatment in the community when compared with standard care. Implications of this research are discussed.","outcomes":["Cost","Health","Housing stability"],"city":"Ottawa","status":"Completed","countryX":"Canada","countryY":"Canada","stateX":"","stateY":"","quality":"Medium quality primary studies"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-75.69","45.421"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"E-37","type":"Effectiveness","studyDesign":"Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs)","studyType":"Impact evaluations","title":"Effectiveness of the Comprehensive Approach to Rehabilitation (CARe) methodology: Design of a cluster randomized controlled trial","year":"2015","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-015-0564-0","authors":"Bitter N A; Roeg D P; Nieuwenhuizen C V; Weeghel J V;","interventionCategories":["Services and outreach","Education and skills"],"populationGroups":["People with/history of mental illness"],"abstract":"Background: There is an increasing amount of evidence for the effectiveness of rehabilitation interventions for people with severe mental illness (SMI). In the Netherlands, a rehabilitation methodology that is well known and often applied is the Comprehensive Approach to Rehabilitation (CARe) methodology. The overall goal of the CARe methodology is to improve the client’s quality of life by supporting the client in realizing his/her goals and wishes, handling his/her vulnerability and improving the quality of his/her social environment. The methodology is strongly influenced by the concept of ‘personal recovery’ and the ‘strengths case management model’. No controlled effect studies have been conducted hitherto regarding the CARe methodology. Methods/design: This study is a two-armed cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) that will be executed in teams from three organizations for sheltered and supported housing, which provide services to people with long-term severe mental illness. Teams in the intervention group will receive the multiple-day CARe methodology training from a specialized institute and start working according the CARe Methodology guideline. Teams in the control group will continue working in their usual way. Standardized questionnaires will be completed at baseline (T0), and 10 (T1) and 20 months (T2) post baseline. Primary outcomes are recovery, social functioning and quality of life. The model fidelity of the CARe methodology will be assessed at T1 and T2. Discussion: This study is the first controlled effect study on the CARe methodology and one of the few RCTs on a broad rehabilitation method or strength-based approach.

A second group of youth was served in similar transitional housing programs that were not exclusively for foster care alumni but instead served homeless youth in general. Comparisons between these two groups reveal that youth in the population-specific programs have less acute initial presentations than foster care alumni in homelessness intervention programs, who had faced more unemployment, school attrition, substance use, and mental health concerns prior to program admission than their peers in the programs specifically for foster care alumni. The research also shows that youth in the homelessness intervention programs had faced more instability during their years in foster care when compared to youth in the population-specific programs for foster care alumni. The research highlights the need for better understanding of the referral process for youth aging out of foster care so that transitional housing programs for young adult foster care alumni can better serve a diversity of youth with different service needs.

METHODS: The sample included all participants enrolled between July 1, 2004, and May 17, 2005, in one of 18 Los Angeles County community mental health centers offering a state-funded program (AB2034) to reduce homelessness among people with serious mental illness. Fifty-six demonstration clients enrolled in three centers received housing and special employment supports. Their outcomes were compared with those of 415 clients enrolled in the county's other 15 AB2034 programs during the same period. Data included demographic characteristics, circumstances at enrollment and in the previous 12 months, and outcomes for at least 13 months after enrollment. Outcomes analyses used propensity score matching. RESULTS: Demonstration clients got and kept housing and worked in paid employment and employment-related activities at rates significantly higher than those of the comparison group. Other than client group, no personal characteristics made any systematic difference to employment outcomes. Several personal characteristics-race and ethnicity, preenrollment length of homelessness, and whether the client had a co-occurring substance use disorder-affected housing outcomes independently of client group. CONCLUSIONS: The demonstration provided the structure and resources to help clients achieve better housing and employment outcomes than the comparison group had. The outcomes for LA's HOPE clients suggest that this very challenged population can achieve improved work outcomes if programs devote adequate and appropriate resources to help them.

Persons living in extreme social exclusion such as individuals experiencing homelessness can benefit from the positive elements of communication and relationship associated with social networking sites. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to suggest the comparison of a Facebook training course and an office software course and their effect on psychological well-being in a group of individuals experiencing homelessness. METHODS: An experimental and longitudinal study was designed. Individuals experiencing homelessness were randomly assigned to either the Facebook group or the office software group, and their social skills, self-esteem, self-efficacy, and satisfaction with life were measured on 4 occasions: pretest, at the end of the training course, 1 month later, and 3 months later. A mixed analysis of variance of repeated measures (2x4) was performed. RESULTS: A total of 92 individuals experiencing homelessness participated in the study. The number of cases in which the 4 measurements were completed was 71 (35 in the intervention group and 36 in the control group). The mixed analysis of variance of repeated measures and the multiple regression analysis indicated a significant increase of the 4 analyzed parameters, with greater significance in the areas of social skills and self-esteem. The critical levels associated to the interaction TimexProgram were significant in all variables and levels. Therefore, the scores in the 4 analyzed constructs were not equal according to the program carried out throughout the work. The effect size associated to the interaction TimexProgram in the social skills scores was large (eta2=0.32); in the self-esteem and self-efficacy scores, it was medium, (eta2=0.13); and in the satisfaction with life scores, it was small (eta2=0.09). The results of the adjustment of the different models of multiple linear regression indicate that the number of hours devoted weekly to the use of Facebook was a predictor of the increase in the scores of social skills (B=3.43, r2=.405) and self-esteem (B=.382). Age (B=.175) and self-efficacy (B=.09) were also variables, which with independence and in equal conditions, predicted self-esteem (r2=.29). Finally, self-esteem (B=.69) was also a predictor variable of the increase of satisfaction with life (r2=.195). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that Facebook could be a key element in homeless psychological well-being and socialization.","outcomes":["Capabilities and Wellbeing"],"city":"Girona","status":"Completed","countryX":"Spain","countryY":"Spain","stateX":"","stateY":"","quality":"Low quality primary studies"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["2.8167","41.9833"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"E-53","type":"Effectiveness","studyDesign":"Systematic reviews","studyType":"Systematic reviews","title":"Interventions for improved diabetes control and self-management among those experiencing homelessness: protocol for a mixed methods scoping review","year":"2019","url":"https://systematicreviewsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13643-019-1020-x","authors":"Campbell D J; Campbell R B; Ziegler C ; McBrien K A; Hwang S W; Booth G L;","interventionCategories":["Accommodation and accommodation-based services","Health and social care"],"populationGroups":["People with existing health conditions (excluding HIV)"],"abstract":"BACKGROUND: Diabetes is a chronic medical condition that requires patients to be actively engaged in intensive self-management to achieve optimal clinical outcomes. Unfortunately, individuals who are experiencing homelessness often struggle to manage diabetes and consequently suffer numerous and severe complications-both acute and chronic. There are many barriers to optimal diabetes self-management among this population, and this may be exacerbated by the lack of tailoring and customization of care to this unique population. Given this disconnect, it is likely that many organizations have attempted to provide specialized innovations for this population-which may or may not be reported in the formal literature. Our objective is to perform a scoping review to summarize and synthesize the experiences of those who have attempted to provide tailored interventions. METHODS: We propose a mixed methods scoping review that will include both a formal search of the published literature (MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, Web of Science, Scopus) and a thorough search of the grey literature. Eligible articles and documents are those that report on an intervention or guideline for the management of diabetes among those experiencing homelessness. All titles and abstracts will undergo duplicate review, as will the full article/document. We will include any report that either includes a description of an intervention or provides recommendations for the treatment of individuals who are homeless with diabetes. We will extract both qualitative and quantitative data for analysis and interpretation. Meta-analysis will not be performed. DISCUSSION: Those experiencing homelessness who also have diabetes often struggle to manage their chronic condition. When care is tailored to suit their needs, it is feasible that outcomes may be improved. By collating and synthesizing information from diverse organizations and jurisdictions, we hope to facilitate the sharing of knowledge with others who wish to provide this type of care.","outcomes":["Capabilities and Wellbeing","Health"],"city":"Toronto","status":"Ongoing","countryX":"Canada","countryY":"Canada","stateX":"","stateY":"","quality":"High quality reviews"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-79.3849","43.6529"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"E-54","type":"Effectiveness","studyDesign":"Before versus after design","studyType":"Impact evaluations","title":"Multi-component smoking cessation treatment including mobile contingency management for smoking cessation in homeless veteran smokers","year":"2015","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4522209/","authors":"Carpenter V L; Hertzberg J S; Kirby A C; Calhoun P S; Moore S D; Dennis M F; Dennis P A; Dedert E A; Hair L P; Beckham J C;","interventionCategories":["Health and social care"],"populationGroups":["Veterans/Ex-services","People with alcohol/drug issues"],"abstract":"Introduction: Smoking rates are 80% among persons who are homeless, and these smokers have decreased odds of quitting smoking. Little is known about relapse rates among homeless smokers. More information is needed regarding both quit rates and innovative methods to treat smoking cessation among homeless smokers. Web-based contingency management (CM) approaches have been found helpful in reducing smoking among other difficult-to-treat smoker populations but have been generally limited by the need for computers or frequent clinic-based carbon monoxide (CO) monitoring. This open pilot study builds on a web-based CM approach by evaluating a smartphone-based application for CM named mobile CM (mCM). The study was conducted from January 1, 2013-April 15, 2014. Method: Following a 1-week training period, 20 homeless veteran smokers (≥ 10 cigarettes daily for 1 year or more and a CO baseline level ≥ 10 ppm) participated in a multicomponent smoking cessation intervention including 4 weeks of mCM. All smokers received 4 smoking cessation counseling sessions, nicotine replacement, and bupropion (if medically eligible). Participants could earn up to $815 ($480 for mCM, $100 for CO readings showing abstinence [ie, 6 ppm or less] at posttreatment and follow-up, and $35 for equipment return). Results: Mean compensation for the mCM component was $286 of a possible $480. Video transmission compliance was high during the 1-week training (97%) and the 4-week treatment period (87%). Bioverified 7-day point prevalence abstinence was 50% at 4 weeks. Follow-up bioverified single assessment point prevalence abstinence was 55% at 3 months and 45% at 6 months. Conclusions: Results of this open pilot study suggest that mCM may be a useful adjunctive smoking cessation treatment component for reducing smoking among homeless veterans.","outcomes":["Health"],"city":"Durham","status":"Completed","countryX":"United States","countryY":"United States","stateX":"North Carolina","stateY":"North Carolina","quality":"Low quality primary studies"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-78.8986","35.994"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"E-55","type":"Effectiveness","studyDesign":"Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs)","studyType":"Impact evaluations","title":"Improving Depression Care for Adults With Serious Mental Illness in Underresourced Areas: Community Coalitions Versus Technical Support","year":"2018","url":"https://ps.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.ps.201600514","authors":"Castillo E G; Shaner R ; Tang L ; Chung B ; Jones F ; Whittington Y ; Miranda J ; Wells K B;","interventionCategories":["Services and outreach","Health and social care","Education and skills"],"populationGroups":["People with/history of mental illness"],"abstract":"Objective: Community Partners in Care (CPIC) was a group-randomized study of two approaches to implementing expanded collaborative depression care: Community Engagement and Planning (CEP), a coalition approach, and Resources for Services (RS), a technical assistance approach. Collaborative care networks in both arms involved health care and other agencies in five service sectors. This study examined six- and 12-month outcomes for CPIC participants with serious mental illness. Methods: This secondary analysis focused on low-income CPIC participants from racial-ethnic minority groups with serious mental illness in underresourced Los Angeles communities (N=504). Serious mental illness was defined as self-reported severe depression (>20 on the Patient Health Questionnaire-8) at baseline or a lifetime history of bipolar disorder or psychosis. Logistic and Poisson regression with multiple imputation and response weights, controlling for covariates, was used to model intervention effects. Results: Among CPIC participants, 50% had serious mental illness. Among those with serious mental illness, CEP relative to RS reduced the likelihood of poor mental health-related quality of life (OR=.62, 95% CI=.41-.95) but not depression (primary outcomes); reduced the likelihood of having homelessness risk factors and behavioral health hospitalizations; increased the likelihood of mental wellness; reduced specialty mental health medication and counseling visits; and increased faith-based depression visits (each p<.05) at six months.

A recent scoping review on housing and wellbeing identified a lack of review-level evidence around the impact of housing interventions on wellbeing of people who are vulnerable to discrimination or exclusion in relation to housing (Preston et al., 2016).. This systematic review was commissioned to address that gap. We synthesise and consider the quality of evidence on how housing interventions can contribute to improving the lives of adults who are vulnerable in relation to the security of their housing tenure (‘housing-vulnerable’ adults). Results Literature search: 90 publications were included in the review, divided into clusters as follows: • Housing First (47) • Other interventions for homeless people with mental health problems (11) • Recovery housing (10) • Supported housing (12) • Housing interventions for ex-prisoners (7) • Housing intervention for vulnerable young people (3) Summary of key findings: Housing First provides immediate access to housing without preconditions with support by either mobile teams or on-site services. Housing First has been evaluated in the UK, in a large Canadian randomised trial (AH/CS), in the USA and other settings. Based on our findings, there is strong evidence that Housing First can improve housing stability and measures of physical health in the short term. Evidence was classed as moderate for positive effects on personal wellbeing, mental health and locality-related wellbeing (‘where we live’) and for absence of effect on personal finance and community wellbeing. Strength of evidence for other outcomes was rated as low or very low. Research identified a range of factors that can affect the effectiveness of Housing First, including fidelity to core components and whether the service is delivered in one place or service users are dispersed in separate apartments. What we classified as ‘other interventions for people with mental/physical health problems’ (11 papers) formed a heterogeneous group of complex interventions. A key finding was that these interventions provide an opportunity for recovery but not everyone benefits. One study suggested that outcomes may be mediated by baseline health status rather than type of intervention. Only one UK study was included in this group. Ten papers examined recovery housing, which is specifically for alcohol or substance use problems. The review found some randomised trial evidence but this was of limited applicability to UK settings. A key finding was that recovery houses can improve personal wellbeing through promoting abstinence from alcohol or illegal drugs. Supported housing (12 papers) is a related but broader concept, for which we included no evidence from the UK. Despite this we found moderate strength of evidence for a positive effect on housing stability. However, strength of evidence for wellbeing outcomes was low or very low. Finally, we examined interventions for other specific groups of housing-vulnerable people. Of seven studies on ex-prisoners, five were from the UK (England),, suggesting relatively high transferability/applicability to similar settings. The main outcome examined in the studies was reduction in offending, which could be linked to both community and individual wellbeing. Three UK studies of housing interventions for vulnerable young people showed generally positive outcomes for wellbeing but the studies were small, short-term and generally uncontrolled. There was a general lack of evidence around measures related to community wellbeing and around cost-effectiveness of the interventions investigated. Only a small number of economic evaluations were included and their relevance to the UK varied (economic studies are sensitive to local context and the results are unlikely to be generalisable between different settings). Conceptual pathway: We used the synthesised evidence to develop a conceptual pathway to illustrate the links between housing and wellbeing for housing-vulnerable people. The pathway proceeds from the initial offer of housing through to longer-term outcomes associated with different types of intervention (defined as 2 years or more). The pathway is structured as a ‘logic model’, highlighting key intermediate outcomesmediators (central elements that may explain changes) and moderators (barriers and facilitators that may influence outcomes). Conclusions Implications for policy and practice: The findings of this systematic review highlight the complexity of the relationship between housing and wellbeing. Overall, we did not find sufficient evidence to demonstrate a linear relationship between housing interventions for vulnerable people, improved housing and improved wellbeing for the individual or community. This may reflect both limitations of the evidence base (relatively few high-quality studies reporting on core wellbeing outcomes) and the complexity of the relationship between housing and wellbeing for vulnerable people with complex needs. It follows that the findings may be difficult to translate into ‘actionable messages’ for policy and practice. Providing housing support for vulnerable people is clearly necessary but may not always be sufficient to improve their wellbeing and that of the community as a whole. The conceptual pathway presented in section 11.3 highlights some of the plausible mechanisms leading to improvements and the associated key moderating factors. In considering how to apply the evidence, decision-makers also need to take into account the wider context, including pressure on local authority budgets and changes in the political environment. Evidence gaps and implications for research: This review has identified substantial evidence gaps. There is a need for further high quality evaluations of interventions that have been or may be implemented in the UK, particularly outside England.. There is a particular requirement for well-designed economic evaluations and studies focusing on the wellbeing dimensions that have been relatively under-researched to date, for example links between vulnerable-housing interventions and education and skills and community wellbeing outcomes. Accompanying cost-effectiveness model: Alongside the systematic review the research team also conducted a cost-effectiveness model of Housing First (Wright et al., 2018). This assessed the costs and benefits of Housing First versus a Staircase model over a two-year period and considered the uncertainty around costs and benefits for both approaches. Methods We searched six bibliographic databases, performed reference and citation checking and searched the websites of university departments and charities with expertise in housing. We also issued a call for evidence through the What Works Centre for Wellbeing (WWCW).","outcomes":["Capabilities and Wellbeing","Employment and income","Health","Housing stability"],"city":"Sheffield","status":"Completed","countryX":"United Kingdom","countryY":"United Kingdom","stateX":"England","stateY":"England","quality":"Low quality reviews"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-1.4702","53.3807"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"E-57","type":"Effectiveness","studyDesign":"Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs)","studyType":"Impact evaluations","title":"The SUMMIT ambulatory-ICU primary care model for medically and socially complex patients in an urban federally qualified health center: study design and rationale","year":"2018","url":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13722-018-0128-y","authors":"Chan B ; Edwards S T; Devoe M ; Gil R ; Mitchell M ; Englander H ; Nicolaidis C ; Kansagara D ; Saha S ; Korthuis P T;","interventionCategories":["Services and outreach","Health and social care"],"populationGroups":["People with/history of mental illness","People with alcohol/drug issues","People with existing health conditions (excluding HIV)","People leaving social care"],"abstract":"BACKGROUND: Medically complex urban patients experiencing homelessness comprise a disproportionate number of high-cost, high-need patients. There are few studies of interventions to improve care for these populations; their social complexity makes them difficult to study and requires clinical and research collaboration. We present a protocol for a trial of the streamlined unified meaningfully managed interdisciplinary team (SUMMIT) team, an ambulatory ICU (A-ICU) intervention to improve utilization and patient experience that uses control populations to address limitations of prior research. METHODS/DESIGN: Participants are patients at a Federally Qualified Health Center in Portland, Oregon that serves patients experiencing homelessness or who have substance use disorders. Participants meet at least one of the following criteria: > 1 hospitalization over past 6 months; at least one medical co-morbidity including uncontrolled diabetes, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, liver disease, soft-tissue infection; and 1 mental health diagnosis or substance use disorder. We exclude patients if they have < 6 months to live, have cognitive impairment preventing consent, or are non-English speaking. Following consent and baseline assessment, we randomize participants to immediate SUMMIT intervention or wait-list control group. Participants receiving the SUMMIT intervention transfer care to a clinic-based team of physician, complex care nurse, care coordinator, social worker, and pharmacist with reduced panel size and flexible scheduling with emphasis on motivational interviewing, patient goal setting and advanced care planning. Wait-listed participants continue usual care plus engagement with community health worker intervention for 6 months prior to joining SUMMIT. The primary outcome is hospital utilization at 6 months; secondary outcomes include emergency department utilization, patient activation, and patient experience measures. We follow participants for 12 months after intervention initiation. DISCUSSION: The SUMMIT A-ICU is an intensive primary care intervention for high-utilizers impacted by homelessness. Use of a wait-list control design balances community and staff stakeholder needs, who felt all participants should have access to the intervention, while addressing research needs to include control populations. Design limitations include prolonged follow-up period that increases risk for attrition, and conflict between practice and research; including partner stakeholders and embedded researchers familiar with the population in study planning can mitigate these barriers.

We analyze MTO’s impacts on children’s long-term outcomes using tax data. We find that moving to a lower-poverty neighborhood when young (before age 13) increases college attendance and earnings and reduces single parenthood rates. Moving as an adolescent has slightly negative impacts, perhaps because of disruption effects. The decline in the gains from moving with the age when children move suggests that the duration of exposure to better environments during childhood is an important determinant of children’s long-term outcomes.","outcomes":["Employment and income"],"city":"Baltimore","status":"Completed","countryX":"United States","countryY":"United States","stateX":"Maryland","stateY":"Maryland","quality":"Medium quality primary studies"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-76.6108","39.2909"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"E-60","type":"Effectiveness","studyDesign":"Non-experimental design with comparison group","studyType":"Impact evaluations","title":"Comparing Consumer and Nonconsumer Provided Case Management Services for Homeless Persons with Serious Mental Illness","year":"2000","url":"https://journals.lww.com/jonmd/Abstract/2000/07000/Comparing_Consumer_and_Nonconsumer_Provided_Case.9.aspx","authors":"Chinman M J; Rosenheck R ; Lam J A; Davidson L ;","interventionCategories":["Health and social care"],"populationGroups":["People with/history of mental illness"],"abstract":"This study compared the outcomes of services provided by case managers who are mental health system consumers and case managers who were not consumers.

Shelters will be randomized to implement a test-and-treat strategy at different months throughout flu season, treating individuals who present ARI symptoms or new or worsening cough within 2 days (48 hours). Shelters will continue routine surveillance until all offer the test-and-treat strategy. Eligible individuals will be tested on site with a point-of-care molecular influenza test and, if positive, offered antiviral treatment. Individuals with 3-7 days of symptoms, or who choose not to participate in the intervention strategy, will still be eligible for participation in the routine surveillance.

A subgroup analysis compared older (n = 470) and younger (n = 1678) homeless participants across baseline characteristics and 24-month outcomes including housing stability (primary outcome), generic and condition-specific quality of life, community functioning, physical and mental health status, mental health symptom severity, psychological community integration, recovery, and substance use (secondary outcomes). Results: At 24 months, Housing First significantly improved the percentage of days stably housed among older (+43.9%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 38.4% to 49.5%) and younger homeless adults (+39.7%, 95% CI: 36.8% to 42.6%), compared with usual care, with no significant differences between age groups (difference of differences = +4.2%, 95% CI: -2.1% to 10.5%, p = 0.188).

We linked Massachusetts emergency housing assistance data with Medicaid claims between July 2008 and June 2015, constructing episodes of health care 12 months before and 12 months after families entered a shelter. We modeled emergency department visits, hospital admissions, and expenditures over the 24-month period separately For children and adults. Results. Emergency department visits, hospital admissions, and expenditures rose steadily before shelter entry and declined gradually afterward, ending, in most cases, near the starting point. Infants, pregnant women, and individuals with depression, anxiety, or substance use disorder had significantly higher rates of all outcomes. Many children's emergency department visits were potentially preventable. Conclusions. Increased service utilization and expenditures begin months before families become homeless and are potentially preventable with early intervention. Infants are at greater risk.

Shorter time to first hospitalization was associated with male gender, diagnoses other than schizophrenia, high psychiatric symptomatology and lower provider case load. ER visits were associated with increased client symptomatology. Shorter times to homelessness were predicted by poorer therapeutic alliance between case manager and clients. Shorter time to first arrest was predicted by client minority status and enrollment in usual care.

Abstinence-based treatment, however, does not optimally engage or treat this population. Thus, harm reduction treatment for alcohol (HaRT-A) was developed together with people with lived experience of homelessness and AUD and community-based agencies that serve them. HaRT-A is a compassionate and pragmatic approach that aims to help people reduce alcohol-related harm and improve quality of life (QoL) without requiring abstinence or use reduction. A three-month, two-arm randomized controlled trial was conducted to test the initial efficacy of HaRT-A compared to a services-as-usual control condition. METHODS: People experiencing homelessness and AUD (N = 168; 24% women) were recruited in community-based clinical and social services settings. Self-reported alcohol use, alcohol-related harm, motivation, and QoL as well as urinary ethyl glucuronide were assessed over a 3-month follow-up. Participants were randomized to receive HaRT-A or services as usual. Over four sessions, HaRT-A interventionists delivered three components: a) collaborative tracking of participant-preferred alcohol metrics, b) elicitation of harm-reduction and QoL goals, and c) discussion of safer-drinking strategies. RESULTS: Compared to control participants, HaRT-A participants reported significantly greater increases in confidence to engage in harm reduction and decreases in peak alcohol use, alcohol-related harm, AUD symptoms, and positive urinary ethyl glucuronide tests (ps < .05). Findings were inconclusive regarding group differences on QoL (ps > .12). CONCLUSION:A low-barrier, low-intensity, patient-driven, harm-reduction approach has at least short-term efficacy in improving AUD outcomes in this population.

Participants are currently/formerly homeless, alcohol dependent individuals (N=300). Outcomes include alcohol variables (i.e., craving, quantity/frequency, problems and biomarkers), health-related quality of life, and publicly funded service utilization and associated costs. Mediators include 10-point motivation rulers and the Penn Alcohol Craving Scale. XR-NTX and harm-reduction counseling are administered every 4weeks over the 12-week treatment course. Follow-up assessments are conducted at weeks 24 and 36.DISCUSSION: If found efficacious, XR-NTX and harm-reduction counseling will be well-positioned to support reductions in alcohol-related harm, decreases in costs associated with publicly funded service utilization, and increases in quality of life among homeless, alcohol-dependent individuals.BACKGROUND: Interventions requiring abstinence from alcohol are neither preferred by nor shown to be highly effective with many homeless individuals with alcohol dependence. It is therefore important to develop lower-threshold, patient-centered interventions for this multimorbid and high-utilizing population. Harm-reduction counseling requires neither abstinence nor use reduction and pairs a compassionate style with patient-driven goal-setting. Extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX), a monthly injectable formulation of an opioid receptor antagonist, reduces craving and may support achievement of harm-reduction goals. Together, harm-reduction counseling and XR-NTX may support alcohol harm reduction and quality-of-life improvement.","outcomes":["Capabilities and Wellbeing","Cost","Health"],"city":"Washington DC","status":"Ongoing","countryX":"United States","countryY":"United States","stateX":"Washington","stateY":"Washington","quality":"Medium/high quality primary studies"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-77.0366","38.895"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"E-69","type":"Effectiveness","studyDesign":"Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs)","studyType":"Impact evaluations","title":"Case Managed Residentiai Care for Homeless Addicted Veterans","year":"1998","url":"https://journals.lww.com/lww-medicalcare/Abstract/1998/01000/Case_Managed_Residential_Care_for_Homeless.6.aspx","authors":"Conrad K J; Hultman C I; Pope A R; Lyons J S; Baxter W C; Daghestani A N; Lisiecki Jr JP; Elbaum P L; McCarthy Jr M; Manheim L M;","interventionCategories":["Prevention","Services and outreach","Health and social care","Education and skills"],"populationGroups":["Veterans/Ex-services","People with/history of mental illness","People with alcohol/drug issues"],"abstract":"Objectives: The effectiveness of case-managed residential care (CMRC) in reducing substance abuse, increasing employment, decreasing homelessness, and improving health was examined.

Strengths profiling is one such tool that enables a person-centered and autonomy supportive approach to the identification of character strengths. Strength profiling is an adaptation of performance profiling used in sport psychology, which has not yet been utilized in broader psychological research or clinical practice. Supporting an individual by raising awareness of their personal character strengths is an effective and growing mechanism for promoting psychological well-being. Strengths profiling involves several stages of exploring, defining, and assessing character strengths, leading to the identification of signature strengths and goals for future development. Informed by personal construct theory, the present study explored the experiences of homeless young people living in sheltered accommodation (N = 116), when using strengths profiling at the start and end of a 10-week, strengths-based intervention. Mixed-method data was obtained from the strengths profiles, questionnaires measuring resilience, self-worth, and well-being, and diary entries. Findings revealed a rich array of character strength terminology and individual meanings. Participants found strengths profiling to be highly engaging, particularly due to their active role in strength identification, which prompted interesting and meaningful reflections on character strengths that were pertinent to them. Participants felt their signature strengths were vital protective factors within their lives and strengths profiles were correlated with resilience, self-worth, and well-being. Character strengths and resilience were also significantly and meaningfully improved pre/post-intervention, providing support for the use of strengths profiling as a tool for monitoring change in character strength perceptions. Overall, this study demonstrates the utility and versatility of strengths profiling as a new method in the discipline of positive psychology and strengths-based research and applied practice.

To explore the processes of successful intervention and models of change in this area, and to understand how intervention effectiveness may vary in different contexts. Search methods: We searched the following bibliographic databases, from inception to 2012, and various relevant non‐governmental and organisational websites: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE and PreMEDLINE; EMBASE and EMBASE Classic; CINAHL; PsycINFO; ERIC; Sociological Abstracts; Social Services Abstracts; Social Work Abstracts; Healthstar; LILACS; System for Grey literature in Europe (OpenGrey); ProQuest Dissertations and Theses; EconLit; IDEAS Economics and Finance Research; JOLIS Library Catalog of the holdings of the World Bank Group and IMF Libraries; BLDS (British Library for Development Studies); Google, Google Scholar. Selection criteria: The review included data from harm reduction or reintegration promotion intervention studies that used a comparison group study design and were all randomised or quasi‐randomised studies. Studies were included if they evaluated interventions aimed to benefit street‐connected children and young people, aged 0 to 24 years, in all contexts. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. Data were extracted on intervention delivery, context, process factors, equity and outcomes. Outcome measures were grouped according to whether they measured psychosocial outcomes, risky sexual behaviours or substance use. A meta‐analysis was conducted for some outcomes though it was not possible for all due to differences in measurements between studies. Other outcomes were evaluated narratively. Main results: We included 11 studies evaluating 12 interventions from high income countries. We did not find any sufficiently robust evaluations conducted in low and middle income countries (LMICs) despite the existence of many relevant programmes. Study quality overall was low to moderate and there was great variation in the measurement used by studies, making comparison difficult. Participants were drop‐in and shelter based. We found no consistent results on a range of relevant outcomes within domains of psychosocial health, substance misuse and sexual risky behaviours despite the many measurements collected in the studies. The interventions being evaluated consisted of time limited therapeutically based programmes which did not prove more effective than standard shelter or drop‐in services for most outcomes and in most studies. There were favourable changes from baseline in outcomes for most particpants in therapy interventions and also in standard services. There was considerable heterogeneity between studies and equity data were inconsistently reported. No study measured the primary outcome of reintegration or reported on adverse effects. The review discussion section included consideration of the relevance of the findings for LMIC settings. Authors' conclusions: Analysis across the included studies found no consistently significant benefit for the ‘new’ interventions compared to standard services for street‐connected children and young people. These latter interventions, however, have not been rigorously evaluated, especially in the context of LMICs. Robustly evaluating the interventions would enable better recommendations to be made for service delivery. There is a need for future research in LMICs that includes children who are on the streets due to urbanisation, war or migration and who may be vulnerable to risks such as trafficking.","outcomes":["Capabilities and Wellbeing","Health","Housing stability"],"city":"Seoul","status":"Completed","countryX":"South Korea","countryY":"South Korea","stateX":"","stateY":"","quality":"High quality reviews"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["126.977","37.568"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"E-72","type":"Effectiveness","studyDesign":"Non-experimental design with comparison group","studyType":"Impact evaluations","title":"The impact of permanent supportive housing on homeless populations","year":"2017","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1051137715300474","authors":"Corinth K ;","interventionCategories":["Accommodation and accommodation-based services"],"populationGroups":["Other"],"abstract":"Between 2007 and 2014 in the United States, national counts of the homeless population decreased as permanent supportive housing (PSH) for the homeless increased.

One additional PSH bed is associated with between 0.04 and 0.12 fewer homeless people. Second, I estimate causal effects using federal funds allocated to communities for homeless assistance as instruments; funding decisions are based on information that precedes any current shocks to homeless populations. Adding one PSH bed reduces the homeless count by up to 0.10 people, and I can reject a reduction of more than 0.72 people at the 95% confidence level. Finally, I discuss several possible explanations for the relatively modest impact, including poor targeting, differential exit rates into private housing from PSH relative to homelessness, incentives for remaining homeless, errors in homeless counts, and migration in response to expanded PSH.","outcomes":["Housing stability"],"city":"Washington DC","status":"Completed","countryX":"United States","countryY":"United States","stateX":"","stateY":"Washington","quality":"Low quality primary studies"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-77.0366","38.895"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"E-74","type":"Effectiveness","studyDesign":"Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs)","studyType":"Impact evaluations","title":"Outcome of a Controlled Trial of the Effectiveness of Intensive Case Management for Chronic Public Inebriates","year":"1998","url":"https://www.jsad.com/doi/abs/10.15288/jsa.1998.59.523","authors":"Cox G B; Walker R D; Freng S A; Short B A; Meijer L ; Gilchrist L ;","interventionCategories":["Services and outreach"],"populationGroups":["People with alcohol/drug issues"],"abstract":"Objective: The objective of this study was to test whether an intensive case management intervention would be effective with a group of homeless chronic public inebriate clients.

They will receive an explanation of how to use the product and a â€˜guide to e‐cigarettesâ€™ fact‐sheet. E‐liquids will be supplied for four weeks at weekly intervals by centre staff. Evidence suggests that smokers successfully transition to vaping with higher nicotine e‐liquids, thus we have opted for the 2 higher strength e‐liquids (12 and 18 mg/mL). Evidence also suggests that smokers have different preferences regarding flavours, so a choice of flavours will be offered (e.g. tobacco, menthol, fruit & bakery). Participants will be given time to try different flavours and nicotine strengths at baseline and be permitted to switch between flavours in accordance with documented vaping practices.

A major challenge for cognitive therapy has been how to modify schemas when they are so enduring and stable. We propose that because maladaptive schemas are formed through social experiences (typically abusive or neglectful ones), they might best be corrected through positive social experiences that directly challenge the schema. Design Two longitudinal studies were conducted, one with patients undergoing group cognitive-behavioural therapy (N = 92) and one with homeless individuals residing in temporary accommodation (N = 76). Method In each study, social isolation schema was measured at Time 1 and again at Time 2 following a group-based social experience (group psychotherapy or temporary residence at a community organization). A positive experience of group life was operationalized as social identification with the therapy group in Study 1 or the community organization in Study 2. Results In both studies, social identification led to a significant reduction in social isolation schema. Study 2 indicated that these effects were fully mediated by the formation of ties to new social groups, such that social identification scaffolded the development of new group memberships, which in turn decreased the endorsement of maladaptive schema. Conclusions Social identification facilitates the correction of socially situated schema such as social isolation.","outcomes":["Capabilities and Wellbeing","Health"],"city":"Brisbane","status":"Completed","countryX":"Australia","countryY":"Australia","stateX":"","stateY":"","quality":"Low quality primary studies"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-122.4","37.6808"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"E-79","type":"Effectiveness","studyDesign":"Before versus after design","studyType":"Impact evaluations","title":"Rapid re-housing: What the research says","year":"2015","url":"http://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/54201/2000265-Rapid-Re-housing-What-the-Research-Says.pdf?l=ri","authors":"Cunningham M ; Gillespie S ; Anderson J ;","interventionCategories":["Accommodation and accommodation-based services"],"populationGroups":["Families with children"],"abstract":"","outcomes":["Cost","Housing stability"],"city":"Washington DC","status":"Completed","countryX":"United States","countryY":"United States","stateX":"Washington","stateY":"Washington","quality":"Low quality primary studies"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-77.0366","38.895"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"E-80","type":"Effectiveness","studyDesign":"Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs)","studyType":"Impact evaluations","title":"At home/chez soi project: Vancouver site final report","year":"2014","url":"https://acdresearch.med.ubc.ca/projects/at-homechez-soi-study/","authors":"Currie L B; Moniruzzaman A ; Patterson M L; Somers J M;","interventionCategories":["Services and outreach","Accommodation and accommodation-based services"],"populationGroups":["People with/history of mental illness"],"abstract":"","outcomes":["Capabilities and Wellbeing","Cost","Health","Housing stability"],"city":"Vancouver","status":"Completed","countryX":"Canada","countryY":"Canada","stateX":"","stateY":"","quality":"Low quality primary studies"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-123.1139","49.2609"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"E-81","type":"Effectiveness","studyDesign":"Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs)","studyType":"Impact evaluations","title":"Continuity of Care among People Experiencing Homelessness and Mental Illness: Does Community Follow-up Reduce Rehospitalization?","year":"2018","url":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1475-6773.12992","authors":"Currie L B; Patterson M L; Moniruzzaman A ; McCandless L C; Somers J M;","interventionCategories":["Health and social care"],"populationGroups":["People with/history of mental illness"],"abstract":"OBJECTIVE: To examine whether timely outpatient follow-up after hospital discharge reduces the risk of subsequent rehospitalization among people experiencing homelessness and mental illness.

RRH families receiving rental assistance services had significantly greater odds of entering permanent housing. Among permanently housed families, at least one family member in 10.9% of HP recipients and 18.8% of RRH recipients reentered homeless services. HP families with younger children and one veteran family member were at increased risk of reentry to homelessness services.

By providing a small rental subsidy to eligible individuals and their families who are already stably housed, the philosophy of the program is to prevent homelessness before it starts. The housing outcomes of 185 PI clients were compared to those of 218 people who were not enrolled in the program but were presumed eligible for it, controlling for sociodemographic, HIV disease, and behavioral health characteristics. Using survival analysis techniques, non-program participants were found to be more likely to leave their rental housing at any given point in time compared to PI program participants. After one year of follow-up, while 99% of PI clients remained stably housed in their program-subsidized rental unit, only 32% of comparison group clients were still in rental housing. At two years, 96% of PI participants remained independently housed, compared to only 10% of non-participants. The success of the program suggests that Project Independence should be replicated and evaluated in other jurisdictions where a relatively high incidence and prevalence of HIV/AIDS is combined with a lack of affordable housing for low income households.

The minority who struggle to adjust to life outside the services report finding it challenging fitting in to post-service life and identity. These individuals often require additional support to truly resettle, which may be provided through third-sector services. There is currently little UK based evidence on the appropriateness and effectiveness of the third-sector provision for the Armed Forces community. There is also limited knowledge on UK military-civilian occupational identity. Methods: This thesis employed a mixed methods approach to address these gaps. The study data came from an independent evaluation of the support provided by the charity Walking With The Wounded (WWTW); Head Start, a mental health programme; First Steps, an vocational support programme; and Home Straight, an employment support programme for homeless veterans. Alongside this, interviews were conducted with beneficiaries of the charity to provide an understanding of the needs/views of both their WWTW and post-military experiences. WWTW aimed to use this evaluation to improve their service provision. Results: The Head Start programme achieved sustained, significant clinical improvement in anxiety symptoms, with significant improvements in functional impairment for those who achieved clinically symptomatic improvement. This was not found for symptoms of depression. Due to low response rates, First Steps and Home Straight could only be evaluated qualitatively. Additionally, qualitative exploration led to the identification of five veteran identity typologies (Transformed Veteran, Civilian Veteran, Enduring Soldier, Lost Veteran and Rejected Veteran), each with varied social and economic outcomes. Findings suggests that acceptance of identity change (influenced by validation, gratitude, military support and group status) contributes to our understanding of the relationship between pre-discharge and discharge experiences/identity and post-military identity. Conclusion: Findings suggest that occupational identity may be crucial for later occupational and societal integration and support services have a vital role in aiding this process (alongside earlier resettlement provision). The recommendations and implications for these findings include, increasing the harmony and collaboration by necessary AF community stakeholders (e.g. charities, government, civilian employers and the AF) to encourage positive transition and acceptance of change. This may include psychological preparation for civilian life and work, both earlier in the discharge process and in later third-sector support for those who continue to find the transition a challenge. The role work readiness and support services play in occupational transition is also discussed.","outcomes":["Employment and income","Health"],"city":"London","status":"Completed","countryX":"United Kingdom","countryY":"United Kingdom","stateX":"England","stateY":"","quality":"Low quality primary studies"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-0.1276","51.5073"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"E-88","type":"Effectiveness","studyDesign":"Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs)","studyType":"Impact evaluations","title":"A randomized experiment of a prisoner reentry program: updated results from an evaluation of the Minnesota Comprehensive Offender Reentry Plan (MCORP)","year":"2013","url":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1478601X.2013.850081","authors":"Duwe G ;","interventionCategories":["Services and outreach"],"populationGroups":["Ex-prisoners"],"abstract":"Using a randomized experimental design, this study evaluated the effectiveness of the Minnesota Comprehensive Offender Reentry Plan (MCORP), an offender reentry pilot project implemented in 2008. In an effort to reduce recidivism, MCORP attempted to increase offender access to community services and programming by producing greater case management collaboration between caseworkers in prison and supervision agents in the community. The results showed that MCORP significantly improved employment rates, decreased homelessness, broadened offenders' systems of social support, and increased the extent to which offenders participated in community support programming (mentoring, restorative justice services, and faith-based programming). The findings further revealed that MCORP significantly reduced all three types of reoffending (rearrest, reconviction, and new offense reincarcerations) but did not have a significant impact on supervision revocations for technical violations. The evidence suggests that MCORP was effective in decreasing reoffending largely because it increased the extent to which offenders were employed, involved in community support programming, and able to develop systems of social support.

Low-demand supportive housing with no prerequisites for treatment or sobriety has been shown to improve housing stability and decrease public service use for chronically homeless persons with serious mental illness (SMI) and chronic medical conditions. The impact of low-demand housing on individuals with SUD but without co-occurring SMI has been little studied. This evaluation compares housing retention and use of crisis public services (jail, emergency department visits, hospitalization, and substance detoxification) between individuals treated and untreated for SUD before move-in to a low-demand supportive housing program in New York City. METHODS:The authors used matched administrative records for individuals with SUD but no SMI placed in supportive housing during 2007-2012. Participants received SUD treatment (n = 1425; treated participants) or were not treated (n = 512; active users) at housing application. Propensity score-weighted regression analyses were used to best estimate the effect of SUD treatment on incarceration, public service utilization, and housing retention. RESULTS:Persons not treated for SUD had a significantly longer tenure in supportive housing than treated participants. However, not treated tenants were more likely to be incarcerated. Opioid agonist therapy and older age decreased the risk of housing discharge, whereas detoxification and inpatient SUD treatment increased the risk of discharge.

Despite positive research findings on housing and hospitalisations outcomes and the spreading of this new model in developed countries, policy-makers are concerned by the inability of individuals to pay for their whole rent. I evaluate the impact of Housing First on financial outcomes using a randomized controlled trial including 703 homeless individuals with severe mental disorders in four major French cities. I observe differential non-response between the treatment and control group ranging from 11 to 20 percentage points for the four follow-up surveys. While previous Housing First evaluations ignored the severe risk of bias, I account for potential selection on unobservables using a recent development in bounding methods. I show that 42% of participants at baseline do not take income support while being eligible to it, a much higher figure than previously estimated in the French homeless population. However, I do not find any effect of Housing First on take-up relatively to a control group receiving pre-existing accompaniment policies. While I do find that Housing First decreases financial poverty, the effect only occurs through an increase in the receipt of housing allowances. I emphasize the importance of considering the take-up of both income support and disability benefits as means to reduce financial poverty of participants to Housing First programs.","outcomes":["Employment and income","Housing stability"],"city":"Paris","status":"Completed","countryX":"France","countryY":"France","stateX":"","stateY":"","quality":"High quality primary studies"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["2.3518","48.8566"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"E-102","type":"Effectiveness","studyDesign":"Systematic reviews","studyType":"Systematic reviews","title":"Mobile telephone‐delivered contingency management interventions promoting behaviour change in individuals with substance use disorders: a meta‐analysis: (Alcoholism and Drug Addiction)","year":"2019","url":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/add.14725","authors":"Getty C A; Morande A ; Lynskey M ; Weaver T ; Metrebian N ;","interventionCategories":["Services and outreach","Health and social care"],"populationGroups":["People with/history of mental illness","People with alcohol/drug issues"],"abstract":"Background/aimsContingency management (CM) interventions have gained considerable interest due to their success in the treatment of addiction.

METHODS: Participants were recruited between 30 August 2013 and 31 October 2015, including clients residing in a Victorian southern Melbourne metropolitan suburb, who registered with the CHN and stakeholders from local service provider organisations engaging with the CHN. A collaborative approach using demographic data collected from client records to identify need and measure the time clients took to engage and access services, qualitative data gathered during Stakeholder Advisory Group meetings and feedback from face-to-face interviews with service organisation representatives informed refinement of the CHN model. RESULTS: Thirty-nine clients (22 Female, mean age 50+/-11 years) participated. Clients engaged with services after an average of seven CHN visits. Eighteen clients independently accessed services after approximately 9 weeks, including medical and housing services. Client need and feedback from 20 stakeholders and three community nurses contributed to refining the model to ensure it met local needs and informed the necessary organisational framework, the CHN role and the attributes, knowledge and the skills required. CONCLUSION: A collaborative CHN model of support for people at risk of or experiencing homelessness has been articulated.

METHODS: A total of 303 homeless shelter residents with severe mental illness were screened for dangerousness, 118 were randomly assigned to either independent apartment or staffed group living sites, and 110 were followed for 18 months. Study participants' sociodemographic characteristics, diagnosis, and residential preferences and the residential recommendations made by clinicians were measured at baseline. RESULTS: Overall, 76 percent of the study participants were housed at the end of the 18-month follow-up period, although 27 percent had experienced at least one episode of homelessness during the period. The number of days homeless was greater for individuals assigned to independent apartments than for those placed in staffed group homes, but only for members of minority groups. Substance abuse was the strongest individual-level predictor of days homeless. Individuals whom clinicians identified as needing group living experienced more days homeless, irrespective of the type of housing they received. Consumers who stated a strong preference for independent living had more days homeless than those who were amenable to staffed group homes. CONCLUSIONS: Although consumers more frequently prefer independent living, placement in staffed group housing resulted in somewhat fewer days homeless for some groups of consumers. Further experience of homelessness by formerly homeless mentally ill individuals may be reduced by providing effective substance abuse treatment and by paying special attention to consumers identified by clinicians to be at particular risk for housing loss.","outcomes":["Health","Housing stability"],"city":"Boston","status":"Completed","countryX":"United States","countryY":"United States","stateX":"Massachusets","stateY":"Massachusets","quality":"High quality primary studies"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-71.063611","42.358056"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"E-106","type":"Effectiveness","studyDesign":"Non-experimental design with comparison group","studyType":"Impact evaluations","title":"Homelessness prevention in New York City: On average, it works","year":"2016","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1051137716000024","authors":"Goodman S ; Messeri P ; O'Flaherty B ;","interventionCategories":["Services and outreach"],"populationGroups":["Families with children"],"abstract":"This study evaluates the community impact of the first four years of Homebase, a homelessness prevention program in New York City.

The event seeks to meet immediate needs, identify potential future needs, and provide a connection with community resources for further follow-up for these adults. Health professions students and faculty from the university where the event is held volunteer their time to provide these services. Risk assessment for type 2 diabetes, A1C measurement, and evaluation of the ADA Standards of Medical Care were available for participants of this event. RESULTS: Of the 478 participants who completed a risk assessment for diabetes, 91 underwent rapid A1C testing.

Evidence-based approaches to active case finding (ACF) are needed. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of ACF for TB control, and identify strategies to improve uptake of screening and the diagnostic pathway in homeless populations in low- and medium-burden settings. Secondary objectives were to assess the yield of screening and participant characteristics. DESIGN: A systematic search of electronic databases and grey literature sources identified ACF studies that reported population measures (prevalence or incidence) of TB control, and/or uptake and/or yield of screening for latent tuberculous infection (LTBI) or active TB affecting any site. Studies were described using narrative synthesis. RESULTS: Twenty studies met the inclusion criteria. Studies were heterogeneous across multiple elements, including programme design, which likely contributed to variability in outcomes. ACF was associated with reductions in TB rates in three time-trend analyses. The strongest evidence for improving uptake of screening was for incentives, with mixed evidence for peer educators. At the observational level, professional support and mandatory screening may also improve uptake, and additional community support enhanced completion of the diagnostic pathway. Those most likely to be diagnosed with TB appeared less likely to accept screening. Yield of screening was 1.5-57% (41 684 participants) for LTBI, and 0-3.1% (91 771 participants) for active TB. CONCLUSION: Observational evidence suggests that ACF is effective. Strategies to improve screening uptake were identified.

In Ottawa, in 2015, there were 6,825 people using 500,191 bed nights in the city emergency shelters (Alliance to End Homelessness in Ottawa 2015 Annual Report) with approximately another 500 sleeping on the streets (The Homelessness Community Capacity Building Steering Committee 2008 Ottawa, ON). Mental health disorders, including substance abuse, are common in this population, are often under treated and can be a source of considerable distress and disability. In addition to the high rates of mental disorder, there are three other significant factors which impact morbidity. First, a history of significant childhood trauma is common which impacts relationships and ability to cope with difficulties. It is increasingly recognized that a trauma informed approach to providing services to the homeless population is needed. There have been no randomized controlled trials of treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder in the homeless population. Second, brain dysfunction from head injuries and attention deficit disorder appear to be common. Problems with brain dysfunction can cause difficulties especially with attention, impulsivity and managing relationships. Finally, life for the marginally housed can be chaotic with day-to-day uncertainty over accommodation, income and security. This means that providing health services to this population requires a degree of flexibility in terms of who provides services, where and when. These issues result in a population with complex needs that traditional mental health care is poorly equipped to serve. At present there is a clear gap in the provision of services that address the experience of trauma in homeless individuals. There are no services for trauma in publicly funded hospitals, which leaves private providers as the sole source of treatment. Other potential barriers include accounting for the effects of substance abuse, brain injury and \"chaos\" in this population. What the investigators are proposing is a pilot study to assess the feasibility and acceptability of providing a time-limited assessment and therapy (six sessions) within the shelter system to homeless individuals diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder.","outcomes":["Capabilities and Wellbeing","Health","Housing stability"],"city":"Ottawa","status":"Ongoing","countryX":"Canada","countryY":"Canada","stateX":"","stateY":"","quality":"Ongoing"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-75.69","45.421"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"E-124","type":"Effectiveness","studyDesign":"Non-experimental design with comparison group","studyType":"Impact evaluations","title":"HIV Treatment Cascade by Housing Status at Enrollment: Results from a Retention in Care Cohort","year":"2019","url":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10461-018-2295-y","authors":"Hawk M ; Maulsby C ; Enobun B ; Kinsky S ;","interventionCategories":["Prevention","Services and outreach","Accommodation and accommodation-based services","Health and social care"],"populationGroups":["Women and girls","HIV patients"],"abstract":"Though housing instability is linked to poor HIV health outcomes, studies that assess the HIV treatment cascade by housing status are limited.

This meta-analysis appraised internationally published literature investigating the impact of transitional programme participation (among youth with a baseline age of 15-24 years) on post-transition outcomes of housing, education, employment, mental health and substance use. A comprehensive search of sociology (e.g. ProQuest Sociology), psychology (e.g. PsycInfo) and health (e.g. ProQuest Family Health) electronic abstraction databases was conducted for the period 1990-2014. Search terms included 'out-of-home care', 'transition', 'housing', 'education', 'employment', 'mental health' and 'substance use'. Nineteen studies, all from the United States, met the inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. Living independently and homelessness were the most commonly described housing outcomes. Rates of post-transition employment varied, while rates of post-secondary education were low. Depression and alcohol use were commonly reported among transitioning youth. Findings of the meta-analysis showed that attention should be given to the potential benefit of transitional programme participation on outcomes such as housing, employment and education. Moderator analyses showed that these benefits may differ based on study design, sample size and sampling unit, but not for mean age or gender.

Methods: A total of 150 previously homeless men and women who were diagnosed with severe mental illness and were discharged from inpatient psychiatric hospitalization were randomly assigned to receive either usual care or usual care plus CTI. The nine-month CTI intervention aims to gradually pass responsibility for providing ongoing support to community sources that will remain in place after the intervention ends, thereby leading to a durable reduction in the risk of future homelessness. Participants’ housing status was assessed every six weeks for eighteen months via participant self-report collected by interviewers blind to condition. Results: In an intent-to-treat analysis, participants assigned to the CTI group had significantly less homelessness at the end of the follow-up period (the final three six-week intervals) than did those assigned to the control group (OR=0.22, 95% CI=.06--.88).

DESIGN: Embase and MEDLINE (1990-2017) were searched in order to update and extend the 2011 systematic review commissioned by National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), discussing interventions targeting service models and organisational structures for the identification and management of TB in hard-to-reach populations. The NICE and Cochrane Collaboration standards were followed. SETTING: European Union, European Economic Area, European Union candidate countries and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. PARTICIPANTS: Hard-to-reach populations, including migrants, homeless people, drug users, prisoners, sex workers, people living with HIV and children within vulnerable and hard-to-reach populations. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the interventions. RESULTS: From the 19 720 citations found, five new studies were identified, in addition to the six discussed in the NICE review. Community health workers from the same migrant community, street teams and peers improved TB screening uptake by providing health education, promoting TB screening and organising contact tracing. Mobile TB clinics, specialised TB clinics and improved cooperation between healthcare services can be effective at identifying and treating active TB cases and are likely to be cost-effective. No difference in treatment outcome was detected when directly observed therapy was delivered at a health clinic or at a convenient location in the community. CONCLUSIONS: Although evidence is limited due to the lack of high-quality studies, interventions using peers and community health workers, mobile TB services, specialised TB clinics and improved cooperation between health services can be effective to control TB in hard-to-reach populations. Future studies should evaluate the (cost-)effectiveness of interventions on TB identification and management in hard-to-reach populations and countries should be urged to publish the outcomes of their TB control systems.

We evaluated the effectiveness of interventions to improve access to primary care for people who are homeless. Methods We performed a systematic review to identify studies in English published between January 1, 1995, and July 8, 2015, comparing interventions to improve access to a primary care provider with usual care among people who are homeless. The outcome of interest was access to a primary care provider. The risk of bias in the studies was evaluated, and the quality of the evidence was assessed according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group criteria. Results From a total of 4,047 citations, we identified five eligible studies (one randomized controlled trial and four observational studies). With the exception of the randomized trial, the risk of bias was considered high in the remaining studies. In the randomized trial, people who were homeless, without serious mental illness, and who received either an outreach intervention plus clinic orientation or clinic orientation alone, had improved access to a primary care provider compared with those receiving usual care. An observational study that compared integration of primary care and other services for people who are homeless with usual care did not observe any difference in access to a primary care provider between the two groups. A small observational study showed improvement among participants with a primary care provider after receiving an intervention consisting of housing and supportive services compared with the period before the intervention. The quality of the evidence was considered moderate for both the outreach plus clinic orientation and clinic orientation alone, and low to very low for the other interventions. Despite limitations, the literature identified reports of interventions developed to overcome barriers in access to primary care in people who are homeless. The interventions studied are complex and include multiple components that are consistent with proposed dimensions of access to care (availability, affordability, and acceptability). Conclusions Our systematic review of the literature identified various types of interventions that seek to improve access to primary care by attempting to address barriers to care encountered by people who are homeless. Moderate-quality evidence indicates that orientation to clinic services (either alone or combined with outreach) improves access to a primary care provider in adults who are homeless, without serious mental illness, and living in urban centres.","outcomes":["Health"],"city":"Los Angeles","status":"Completed","countryX":"United States","countryY":"United States","stateX":"California","stateY":"California","quality":"Low quality reviews"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-118.2439","34.0544"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"E-132","type":"Effectiveness","studyDesign":"Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs)","studyType":"Impact evaluations","title":"Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of admissions to women’s crisis houses compared with traditional psychiatric wards: pilot patient-preference randomised controlled trial","year":"2011","url":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry/article/effectiveness-and-costeffectiveness-of-admissions-to-womens-crisis-houses-compared-with-traditional-psychiatric-wards-pilot-patientpreference-randomised-controlled-trial/F9042605A8E3BA80B06486BFE362D09E","authors":"Howard L ; Flach C ; Leese M ; Byford S ; Killaspy H ; Cole L ; Lawlor C ; Betts J ; Sharac J ; Cutting P ; McNicholas S ;","interventionCategories":["Health and social care"],"populationGroups":["Women and girls","People with/history of mental illness"],"abstract":"Background Women’s crisis houses have been developed in the UK as a less stigmatising and less institutional alternative to traditional psychiatric wards. Aims To examine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of women’s crisis houses by first examining the feasibility of a pilot patient-preference randomised controlled trial (PP–RCT) design (ISRCTN20804014). Method We used a PP–RCT study design to investigate women presenting in crisis needing informal admission. The four study arms were the patient preference arms of women’s crisis house or hospital admission, and randomised arms of women’s crisis house or hospital admission. Results Forty-one women entered the randomised arms of the trial (crisis house n = 19, wards n = 22) and 61 entered the patientpreference arms (crisis house n = 37, ward n = 24). There was no significant difference in outcomes (symptoms, functioning, perceived coercion, stigma, unmet needs or quality of life) or costs for any of the groups (randomised or preference arms), but women who obtained their preferred intervention were more satisfied with treatment. Conclusions Although the sample sizes were too small to allow definite conclusions, the results suggest that when services are able to provide interventions preferred by patients, those patients are more likely to be satisfied with treatment.

To address the needs of this population, Los Angeles County piloted a program called Breaking Barriers to provide adults on probation with a time-limited rental housing subsidy and housing retention services coupled with case management and employment supports. The primary goals of the Breaking Barriers pilot program were to (1) reduce recidivism, (2) improve participants' housing stability, and (3) improve employment incomes sufficiently for individuals to take over their own rental payments by the end of the program period. This report presents feedback from formative and summative evaluations that were conducted to help provide early findings from this innovative housing-employment initiative. Among the findings, for example, the program successfully housed more than 80 percent of participants, despite the challenges regarding the lack of affordable housing. Researchers also found that most participants did not achieve great gains in employment and associated income during the two-year program period. Each day of housing was associated with a 25-cent increase in the participants' contribution to rent. However, participants who had been in the program for two years were contributing on average only 19 percent of the total rental amount. For participants who received the full Breaking Barriers intervention (i.e., housing, case management, and employment services), the felony reconviction rate was 13 percent, which is lower than the rate among individuals with prior felonies in California (greater than 20 percent).","outcomes":["Capabilities and Wellbeing","Crime and justice","Employment and income","Housing stability"],"city":"Los Angeles","status":"Completed","countryX":"United States","countryY":"United States","stateX":"California","stateY":"California","quality":"Low quality primary studies"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-118.2439","34.0544"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"E-135","type":"Effectiveness","studyDesign":"Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs)","studyType":"Impact evaluations","title":"Effects of substance abuse on housing stability of homeless mentally ill persons in supported housing","year":"1996","url":"https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1996-05275-005","authors":"Hurlburt M S; Hough R L; Wood P A;","interventionCategories":["Prevention","Services and outreach","Accommodation and accommodation-based services"],"populationGroups":["People with/history of mental illness"],"abstract":"Objective: The study examined two-year housing outcomes of homeless mentally ill clients who took part in an experimental investigation of supported housing. The relationships between housing outcomes and client characteristics, such as gender, psychiatric diagnosis, and substance use, were of primary interest. Methods: A two-factor, longitudinal design was used. Homeless clients in San Diego County who were diagnosed as having chronic and severe mental illness were randomly assigned to four experimental conditions. Half of the clients were given better access to independent housing through Section 8 rent subsidy certificates. All clients received flexible case management, but half were provided more comprehensive case management services. The housing of each individual over a two-year period was classified in one of three categories: stable independent housing, stable housing in another setting in the community, or unstable housing. Results: Clients with access to Section 8 housing certificates were much more likely to achieve independent housing than clients without access to Section 8 certificates, but no differences emerged across the two different levels of case management. Housing stability was strongly mediated by several covariates, especially the presence of problems with drugs or alcohol. Conclusions: Supported housing interventions can be very successful tools for stabilizing homeless mentally ill individuals in independent community settings. Advantages include the low level of restrictiveness of these settings and the preference of many clients for independent housing.

The objectives of this paper are to examine the approach to participant recruitment and community engagement at the Toronto site of the AH/CS Project, and to describe the baseline demographics of participants in Toronto. Methods Homeless individuals (n = 575) with either high needs (n = 197) or moderate needs (n = 378) for mental health support were recruited through service providers in the city of Toronto. Participants were randomized to Housing First interventions or Treatment as Usual (control) groups. Housing First interventions were offered at two different mental health service delivery levels: Assertive Community Treatment for high needs participants and Intensive Case Management for moderate needs participants. Demographic data were collected via quantitative questionnaires at baseline interviews. Results The effectiveness of the recruitment strategy was influenced by a carefully designed referral system, targeted recruitment of specific groups, and an extensive network of pre-existing services. Community members, potential participants, service providers, and other stakeholders were engaged through active outreach and information sessions. Challenges related to the need for different sectors to work together were resolved through team building strategies. Randomization produced similar demographic, mental health, cognitive and functional impairment characteristics in the intervention and control groups for both the high needs and moderate needs groups. The majority of participants were male (69%), aged >40 years (53%), single/never married (69%), without dependent children (71%), born in Canada (54%), and non-white (64%). Many participants had substance dependence (38%), psychotic disorder (37%), major depressive episode (36%), alcohol dependence (29%), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (23%), and mood disorder with psychotic features (21%). More than two-thirds of the participants (65%) indicated some level of suicidality.

Depletion of nutrients such as vitamin B1 can lead to cognitive impairment, which can hinder efforts to reduce drinking or engage with services. This review aimed to assess effectiveness of interventions designed to prevent or treat malnutrition in homeless problem-drinkers. Methods: We systematically searched nine electronic databases and 13 grey literature sources for studies evaluating interventions to improve nutrition in homeless populations, without regional or language restrictions. Screening for inclusion was done in duplicate. One reviewer extracted data and assessed risk of bias, and another checked the extractions. Primary outcomes were nutrition status/deficiency, liver damage, and cognitive function. Secondary outcomes included abstinence, comorbidities, resource use, acceptability and engagement with intervention. Results were synthesised narratively. Results: We included 25 studies (2 Randomised Controlled Trials; 15 uncontrolled before and after; 7 surveys; 1 case-control). Nine studies evaluated educational and support interventions, five food provision, and three supplement provision. Eight studies evaluated a combination of these interventions. No two interventions were the same, and all studies were at high risk of bias. Nutritional status (intake/ deficiency) were reported in 11 studies and liver function in one. Fruit and vegetable intake improved with some education and support interventions (n = 4 studies) but not others (n = 2). Vitamin supplements appeared to improve vitamin deficiency levels in the blood (n = 2). Free or subsidised meals (n = 4) and food packs (n = 1) did not always fulfil dietary needs, but were usually considered acceptable by users. Some multicomponent interventions improved nutrition (n = 3) but acceptability varied (n= 3). No study reported cost effectiveness. Conclusions: The evidence for any one intervention for improving malnutrition in homeless problem-drinkers was based on single studies at high risk of bias. Various food and supplement provision interventions appear effective in changing nutritional status in single studies. Educational and multicomponent interventions show improved nutritional behaviour in some studies but not others. Further better quality evidence is required before these interventions can be recommended for implementation. Any future studies should seek the end user input in their design and conduct.","outcomes":["Cost","Health"],"city":"Bristol","status":"Completed","countryX":"United Kingdom","countryY":"United Kingdom","stateX":"England","stateY":"England","quality":"Low quality reviews"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-2.5974","51.4535"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"E-142","type":"Effectiveness","studyDesign":"Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs)","studyType":"Impact evaluations","title":"The Rent Reform Demonstration: Interim Findings on Implementation, Work, and Other Outcomes","year":"2019","url":"https://www.mdrc.org/sites/default/files/RentReform-InterimFindings.pdf","authors":"James R ; Verma N ; Deitch V ;","interventionCategories":["Legislation","Prevention"],"populationGroups":["Families with children"],"abstract":"For many years, housing subsidies offered by the federal Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program, which help eligible low-income families cover their rental costs in the private rental market, have been calculated in a manner that may create a disincentive for tenants to work. Because voucher holders pay 30 percent of their income (after certain exclusions and deductions) toward their rent and utilities, their subsidies fall as their incomes rise, creating an implicit marginal “tax” on increased earnings. Critics of this rent policy believe that it also imposes a substantial and costly administrative burden on public housing agencies (PHAs), in part because the policy requires PHAs to adjust subsidies, up or down, as families’ incomes fall or rise, and to apply complicated rules in determining subsidy levels. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) launched the Rent Reform Demonstration to test important modifications to the federal government’s traditional rent policy to determine whether the changes can improve tenants’ success in the labor market and reduce the administrative burden on PHAs in operating the voucher program. The demonstration focuses on families living in privately owned housing units and receiving “tenant-based” vouchers, which are not restricted to any rental building or apartment. This report is the third in an ongoing evaluation of the modifications to HUD’s traditional policy and the second to report on the policy’s impacts. As described in the following, the new policy changes the ways in which subsidies are calculated; introduces or increases the minimum dollar amount families are expected to pay toward their rent and utilities (typically referred to collectively as “minimum rent”); requires no income reporting to the PHA and no reductions in families’ housing subsidies for 3 years, even if their incomes grow; and includes a number of safeguards to protect tenants from excessive rent burden, such as when their incomes decline. The demonstration began enrolling voucher holders in 2015 and is operating in four cities and PHAs: Lexington-Fayette Urban County Housing Authority (generally referred to as the “Lexington Housing Authority”), in Lexington, Kentucky; Louisville Metropolitan Housing Authority, in Louisville, Kentucky; San Antonio Housing Authority, in San Antonio, Texas; and District of Columbia Housing Authority, in Washington, D.C. These housing agencies are a subset of 39 PHAs that, at the time the project was launched, were part of HUD’s Moving to Work (MTW) demonstration program, which allows selected PHAs more administrative flexibility in operating their housing assistance programs. HUD selected MDRC and its partners to lead the initiative,2 working closely with them and the four PHAs to help design a new rent policy and to evaluate it using a randomized controlled trial. This report is the third in a series of five reports on the Rent Reform Demonstration. The first \"Baseline\" report presented initial information on the demonstration’s implementation and on the study participants' original characteristics. The \"Early Effects\" report is second in the series and provides preliminary findings from the first 12 months after the new rent policy went into effect. This \"Interim Findings\" report presents results from the first 27-30 months of followup. It covers the new rent policy’s effects, or “impacts,” on families’ labor market and housing-related outcomes, receipt of other government 2 The study team includes the Urban Institute, the Bronner Group, Quadel Consulting & Training, Ingrid Gould Ellen (New York University), and John Goering (City University of New York). ES-2 benefits, and use of homelessness services. It also uses indepth qualitative interviews conducted with PHA staff and tenants to explore their experiences with, and views of, the new policy. The fourth report in the series (expected in 2021) will present findings from the long-term followup survey and the first triennial recertification, about 36 months after the new rent policy went into effect. The fifth and final report (expected in 2023) will provide concluding findings of the demonstration after the second triennial recertification, about 72 months after the new rent policy effective-date. The results of this current report indicate that, when the findings for all four PHAs are combined, the new policy did not generate statistically significant increases in tenants’ average earnings during the available followup period. The story varied substantially across locations, however, with some positive effects on earnings in Lexington and San Antonio but not in Louisville and Washington, D.C. The new policy increased families’ tenure in the voucher program and the total amount of housing subsidies received; the policy also reduced the number of certain types of PHA transactions with families. As of now, it has had little effect on families’ receipt of other government benefits. A preliminary analysis of administrative costs suggests that the new policy is unlikely to have cost more for PHAs to operate than the existing policy (not counting subsidy expenditures) during the available followup period and may have cost somewhat less.","outcomes":["Cost","Employment and income"],"city":"Lexington","status":"Completed","countryX":"United States","countryY":"United States","stateX":"Kentucky","stateY":"Kentucky","quality":"High quality primary studies"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-84.497","38.0464"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"E-143","type":"Effectiveness","studyDesign":"Before versus after design","studyType":"Impact evaluations","title":"Patient predictors and utilization of health services within a medical home for homeless persons","year":"2018","url":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08897077.2018.1437500","authors":"Jones A L; Thomas R ; Hedayati D O; Saba S K; Conley J ; Gordon A J;","interventionCategories":["Health and social care"],"populationGroups":["Veterans/Ex-services"],"abstract":"BACKGROUND: The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) established a patient-centered medical home model of care for veterans experiencing homelessness called a Homeless Patient Aligned Care Team (HPACT) to improve engagement with primary care and reduce utilization of hospital-based services. To evaluate the impact of the HPACT model, this study compares the number and type of health care visits in the 12 months before and after enrollment in HPACT at one VHA facility, and explores patient characteristics associated with increases and decreases in visits. METHODS: Chart reviews of VHA medical records were conducted for all patients enrolled in an HPACT in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, between May 2012 and December 2013 (N = 179). Multivariable mixed-effect logistic regressions estimated differences in having any visit in the 0-6 months and 7-12 months before and after HPACT enrollment, and multinomial logistic regressions predicted increases or decreases versus no change in number of visits over 12 months. RESULTS: Compared with 0-6 months prior to HPACT, patients were more likely to visit primary care in the 0-6 months (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 4.91, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.94-8.20) and 7-12 months (aOR = 2.30, 95% CI = 1.42-3.72) following HPACT. Patients were less likely to visit the emergency department (ED) or to be hospitalized in the 0-6 months (aOR = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.34-0.94; and aOR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.25-0.76) and 7-12 months (aOR = 0.43, 95% CI = 0.33-0.91; and aOR = 0.45, 95% CI = 0.26-0.80) following HPACT. Patients were less likely to visit mental health (aOR = 0.35, 95% CI = 0.20-0.60) and addiction specialists (aOR = 0.39, 95% CI = 0.18-0.84) in the 7-12 months following HPACT. Overall, 59% of patients had increases in primary care visits following HPACT. Female patients and those with self-housing were less likely to have increases versus no change in primary care visits (adjusted relative risk ratio [aRRR] = 0.15, 95% CI = 0.03-0.74; and aRRR = 0.35, 95% CI = 0.14-0.90).

The authors investigated the cost-effectiveness of the critical time intervention program, a time-limited adaptation of intensive case management, which has been shown to significantly reduce recurrent homelessness among men with severe mental illness. Methods: Ninety-six study participants recruited from a psychiatric program in a men's public shelter from 1991 to 1993 were randomly assigned to the critical time intervention program or to usual services. Costs and housing outcomes for the two groups were examined over 18 months. Results: Over the study period, the critical time intervention group and the usual services group incurred mean costs of 52,374 dollars and 51,649 dollars, respectively, for acute care services, outpatient services, housing and shelter services, criminal justice services, and transfer income. During the same period, the critical time intervention group experienced significantly fewer homeless nights than the usual care group (32 nights versus 90 nights). For each willingness-to-pay value--the additional price society is willing to spend for an additional nonhomeless night--greater than 152 dollars, the critical time intervention group exhibited a significantly greater net housing stability benefit, indicating cost-effectiveness, compared with usual care. Conclusions: Although difficult to conduct, studies of the cost-effectiveness of community mental health programs can yield rich information for policy makers and program planners. The critical time intervention program is not only an effective method to reduce recurrent homelessness among persons with severe mental illness but also represents a cost-effective alternative to the status quo.","outcomes":["Cost","Housing stability"],"city":"New York","status":"Completed","countryX":"United States","countryY":"United States","stateX":"New York","stateY":"New York","quality":"High quality primary studies"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-73.9808","40.7648"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"E-145","type":"Effectiveness","studyDesign":"Systematic reviews","studyType":"Systematic reviews","title":"The effectiveness of interventions during and after residence in women's shelters: A meta-analysis","year":"2015","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/cku092","authors":"Jonker I E; Sijbrandij M ; Van Luijtelaar M J; Cuijpers P ; Wolf J R;","interventionCategories":["Accommodation and accommodation-based services","Health and social care","Education and skills"],"populationGroups":["Survivors of domestic violence/abuse"],"abstract":"Background: Due to intimate partner violence (IPV), a proportion of some women seek safety from their abuser in shelters. Little is known yet about whether the received shelter interventions, offered during and after women's stay, are effective. Therefore, a meta-analysis of studies was performed, testing the effectiveness of interventions administered to female IPV victims during and/or after their residence in shelters, in terms of mental health, re-abuse and social outcomes. Methods: From January 1985 through July 2011, five databases were searched for English-language articles. Original research articles evaluating the effects of interventions provided to IPV victims during and after shelter residence were identified. Hedges' g effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated and pooled if three or more studies including one outcome type were available. Results: Ten original studies, including a total number of 726 female IPV victims, were analysed. We found that shelter interventions were effective in improving mental health outcomes (g = -0.39; 95% CI: 0.24-0.54), in decreasing abuse (g = 0.32; 95% CI: 0.08-0.55) and in improving social outcomes (g = 0.71; 95% CI: 0.54-0.88) in shelter-based abused women. Conclusion: This analysis suggests that interventions provided during and after stay in a shelter are effective in improving mental health, abuse and social outcomes, but further research has to confirm this. Moreover, future studies should compare different type of interventions and should evaluate cost-effectiveness.

Results: Overall, only 8 percent of the more than 65,000 eligible veterans contacted by outreach workers were referred to the program. Those referred were more likely to be female, to have more sources of income, to have recently used VA services (including residential treatment), and to have serious mental health problems. Once in the program, 64 percent of veterans eventually moved into an apartment, and 84 percent of those who obtained an apartment were stably housed one year later. In general, activities of case managers, such as accompanying the veteran to the public housing authority and securing additional sources of income, were associated with success in the housing process. The therapeutic alliance, clients' housing preferences, and the quality of housing were unrelated to retention of housing.

Few data exist, however, to substantiate the implications of chronic homelessness for major health outcomes. Objectives: Using data from a 2-year cohort of addicted persons, we tested whether changes in mental and physical health-related quality of life (HRQOL) differed according to homeless chronicity. Methods: Using self-reported homelessness, we classified subjects as chronically homeless (CH; n = 60), transitionally homeless (TRANS; n = 108), or as housed comparison subjects (HSD; n = 106). The Short Form-36 Health Survey, administered at baseline and 2 follow-ups over a period of 2 years, provided a Mental Component Summary (MCS) and a Physical Component Summary (PCS) for HRQOL. Mixed model linear regression was used to test the association between housing status, MCS, and PCS. Additional models assessed whether medical, psychiatric, addiction, and social support measures could account for HRQOL differences. Results: All subjects had low MCS scores at study entry (mean, 31.2; SD, 12.6). However, there was a significant housing status-by-time interaction (P = 0.01). At final follow-up, CH and TRANS subjects had lower adjusted MCS scores than HSD subjects (33.4, 38.8, and 43.7 for the 3 groups, respectively; all P <= 0.01). By contrast, housing status and PCS were not significantly associated (P = 0.19). Medical, psychiatric, addiction, and social support variables had significant associations with MCS, and their inclusion in the regression reduced the apparent effect of housing status on MCS. Conclusions: Chronic homelessness was associated with especially poor mental but not physical HRQOL over time. These findings reinforce a new typology of homelessness.

Inpatient treatment alone may improve housing stability, especially for street homeless people suffering from psychoses. Designated inpatient services for this group could therefore provide well co-ordinated discharge planning. Aim : To assess whether admission to a designated ward for the homeless mentally ill improves outcome 12 months after discharge in terms of housing stability and engagement with services. Method : A prospective controlled design was used. All clients of a specialist community mental health team for the homeless admitted to hospital during a 12 month period were included. One year after discharge housing stability and engagement with services were compared for clients admitted to the designated ward and those admitted elsewhere. Results : Fifty clients were admitted during the study period, 29 to the designated ward (cases) and 21 elsewhere (controls). Cases were more likely to be street homeless at admission ( p = .02) and had moved more frequently than controls in the preceding 12 months ( p = .04). Both groups were equally likely to be discharged to stable accommodation ( p = .29) and 12 months later there was no difference in their housing stability (proportion in stable housing, p = .46; mean days in stable housing, p = .51). However, there was greater improvement in engagement for cases (mean diff. 4.5, p < .001) compared to controls (2.2, p = .01) and factors influencing medication non-compliance improved only in cases ( p < .0001). Conclusions : A designated ward for the homeless mentally ill encourages admission of street homeless clients and those who are most mobile. At discharge, stable housing can be arranged and sustained as successfully as for those with less entrenched homelessness. Other benefits include improvement in engagement with services and reduction in factors influencing medication non-compliance.

However, there is very little evidence on the effectiveness of Housing First in improving substance use-related outcomes in this population. This study uses a randomized control design to examine the effects of scatter-site Housing First on substance use outcomes in a large urban centre. Methods Substance use outcomes were compared between a Housing First intervention and treatment as usual group in a sample of 575 individuals experiencing homelessness and mental illness, with or without a co-occurring substance use problem, in the At Home/Chez Soi trial in Toronto, Canada. Generalized linear models were used to compare study arms with respect to change in substance use outcomes over time (baseline, 6, 12, 18 and 24 month). Results At 24 months, participants in the Housing First intervention had significantly greater reductions in number of days experiencing alcohol problems and amount of money spent on alcohol than participants in the Treatment as Usual group. No differences between the study arms in illicit drug outcomes were found at 24 months. Conclusions These findings show that a Housing First intervention can contribute to reductions in alcohol problems over time. However, the lack of effect of the intervention on illicit drug problems suggests that individuals experiencing homelessness, mental illness and drug problems may need additional supports to reduce use.","outcomes":["Health"],"city":"Toronto","status":"Completed","countryX":"Canada","countryY":"Canada","stateX":"","stateY":"","quality":"Low quality primary studies"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-79.3849","43.6529"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"E-164","type":"Effectiveness","studyDesign":"Non-experimental design with comparison group","studyType":"Impact evaluations","title":"Health impacts of supportive housing for homeless youth: A pilot study","year":"2008","url":"https://www.publichealthjrnl.com/article/S0033-3506(08)00039-5/fulltext","authors":"Kisely S R; Parker J K; Campbell L A; Karabanow J ; Hughes J M; Gahagan J ;","interventionCategories":["Accommodation and accommodation-based services"],"populationGroups":["Young people"],"abstract":"","outcomes":["Health"],"city":"Halifax","status":"Completed","countryX":"Canada","countryY":"Canada","stateX":"","stateY":"","quality":"Low quality primary studies"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-63.575","44.6484"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"E-165","type":"Effectiveness","studyDesign":"Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs)","studyType":"Impact evaluations","title":"Experimental analysis of neighborhood effects","year":"2007","url":"https://users.nber.org/~kling/mto/mto_exp.pdf","authors":"Kling J R; Liebman J B; Katz L F;","interventionCategories":["Prevention"],"populationGroups":["Families with children"],"abstract":"Families, primarily female‐headed minority households with children, living in high‐poverty public housing projects in five U.S. cities were offered housing vouchers by lottery in the Moving to Opportunity program.

Methods: Homeless individuals with mental illness were randomized to receive Housing First, a scattered-site choice-based housing intervention (without preconditions of sobriety or psychiatric treatment) and mental health services according to the level of need (assertive community treatment or intensive case management), or usual care. Participants completed interviews every 6 months and measures of housing status every 3 months to a total of 24 months. We assessed housing stability as percent days stably housed as a proportion of days for which residence data were available in youth aged 18-24 years, fit a model with a three-way interaction of treatment group (age 18-24 years vs. >24 years), and compared the effect on housing stability in youth versus adults.

Results: Of the 2,148 total participants who were randomized, 156 were youth aged 18-24 years: 87 received Housing First and 69 received usual care.

For patients in the Netherlands who had not responded to earlier voluntary and compulsory treatment, a new treatment facility - Sustainable Residence (SuRe) - was developed to offer long-term compulsory in-patient treatment. Aim of the study: To study patterns of changes in clinical and functional outcomes during treatment at SuRe and how these relate to eventual treatment outcome. Methods: On the basis of the intensity of care needed after four years, three groups of patients were distinguished (total n = 165): those discharged to a less restrictive and less supportive setting (n = 70, 42%), those still hospitalized at SuRe at the end of the four-year study period (n = 69, 42%) and those referred to a more appropriate setting (n = 26, 16%). Random coefficient analysis was used to examine differences between groups regarding changes in clinical and functional outcomes during treatment. During treatment, outcomes were monitored using Routine Outcome Assessment. Results: All three groups made small but significant improvements on global psychosocial functioning, distress and therapeutic alliance (effect sizes (ES) 0.11 to 0.16 per year). Patients who were discharged to a less restrictive setting showed small to moderate improvement in risk to self and others, psychiatric symptoms, and skills for daily living (ES 0.19-0.33 per year and 0.42-0.73 for their mean 2.2-year treatment period). Patients remaining at SuRe showed a small increase in risk to self (ES 0.20 per year; 0.80 for their treatment period of four years or more). Oppositional behaviour was consistently greater in referred patients than in the other groups (ES 0.74-0.75). Conclusion: Long-term compulsory treatment appeared to have helped improve clinical and functional outcomes in a substantial proportion (42%) of previously severely dysfunctional, treatment-resistant dual-diagnosis patients, who could then be discharged to a less restrictive and less supportive environment. However, risk-to-self increased in a similar proportion. A smaller number of patients (16%) showed marked oppositional behaviour and needed a higher level of care and protection in another facility.

Using secondary data, this study examined the housing histories of 65 assertive community treatment (ACT) clients from 2 years prior until up to 7 years after intake, totalling 407 addresses. Method: We used statistical process control to assess the significance and longevity of pre-and post-ACT changes in residential tenure and independent living. We used multivariate survival analysis to explore participant and residence characteristics associated with residential stability. Results: After 6 months in ACT, the client population showed a significant, sustained improvement in housing stability. Similarly, shortly after ACT entry, there was a marked increase in the proportion of participants living independently. At the participant level, substance abuse was the strongest predictor of residential instability; other predictors included age (30 years or younger) and sex (female). Residence characteristics also proved important; independent housing, neighbourhood income (a proxy for housing quality), and receipt of a rental subsidy were associated with significantly longer tenure, controlling for client characteristics. Conclusions: The timing and magnitude of the observed changes imply that ACT was effective in helping clients to achieve stable housing and to live independently. The results also underscore the importance of high-quality housing in promoting residential stability.","outcomes":["Housing stability"],"city":"Winnipeg","status":"Completed","countryX":"Canada","countryY":"Canada","stateX":"","stateY":"","quality":"Low quality primary studies"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-97.1667","49.8833"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"E-174","type":"Effectiveness","studyDesign":"Non-experimental design with comparison group","studyType":"Impact evaluations","title":"Case management is associated with improved antiretroviral adherence and CD4(+) cell counts in homeless and marginally housed individuals with HIV infection","year":"2006","url":"https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/43/2/234/334950","authors":"Kushel MB ; Colfax G ; Ragland K ; Heineman A ; Palacio H ; Bangsberg DR ;","interventionCategories":["Services and outreach"],"populationGroups":["HIV patients"],"abstract":"Background. Case management ( CM) coordinates care for persons with complex health care needs. It is not known whether CM is effective at improving biological outcomes among homeless and marginally housed persons with human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV) infection. Our goal was to determine whether CM is associated with reduced acute medical care use and improved biological outcomes in homeless and marginally housed persons with HIV infection. Methods. We conducted a prospective observational cohort study in a probability-based community sample of HIV-infected homeless and marginally housed adults in San Francisco, California. The primary independent variable was CM, defined as none or rare ( any CM in <= 25% of quarters in the study), moderate ( > 25% but <= 75%), or consistent ( > 75%). The dependent variables were 3 self-reported health service use measures ( receipt of primary care, emergency department visits and hospitalizations, and antiretroviral therapy adherence) and 2 biological measures ( increase in CD4(+) cell count of >= 50% and geometric mean HIV load of <= 400 copies/mL). Results. In multivariate models, CM was not associated with increased primary care, emergency department use, or hospitalization. Moderate CM, compared with no or rare CM, was associated with an adjusted beta coefficient of 0.13 ( 95% confidence interval [ CI], 0.02 - 0.25) for improved antiretroviral adherence. Consistent CM ( adjusted odds ratio [ AOR], 10.7; 95% CI, 2.3 - 49.6) and moderate CM ( AOR, 6.5; 95% CI, 1.3 - 33.0) were both associated with >= 50% improvements in CD4+ cell count. CM was not associated with geometric HIV load < 400 copies/mL when antiretroviral therapy adherence was included in the model. Study limitations include a lack of randomization. Conclusion. CM may be a successful method to improve adherence to antiretroviral therapy and biological outcomes among HIV-infected homeless and marginally housed adults.","outcomes":["Health"],"city":"San Francisco","status":"Completed","countryX":"United States","countryY":"United States","stateX":"California","stateY":"California","quality":"Low quality primary studies"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-122.463","37.7648"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"E-175","type":"Effectiveness","studyDesign":"Systematic reviews","studyType":"Systematic reviews","title":"Effects of housing circumstances on health, quality of life and healthcare use for people with severe mental illness: a review","year":"2008","url":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2524.2007.00723.x","authors":"Kyle T ; Dunn J R;","interventionCategories":["Prevention","Services and outreach","Accommodation and accommodation-based services"],"populationGroups":["People with/history of mental illness"],"abstract":"Individuals with severe and persistent mental illness (SPMI) identify housing as an important factor in achieving and maintaining their health. However, many live in substandard accommodations that are physically inadequate, crowded, noisy and located in undesirable neighbourhoods. In much of the research on housing for persons with SPMI, the central outcome of interest is remaining housed; however, it is worth investigating whether housing has other benefits. This paper is a systematic review of studies that investigated the relationship between housing-related independent variables and health-related dependent variables. Ten online databases were searched for studies published since 1980 that had study populations of adults with SPMI, analysed primary or secondary empirical data, and measured housing-related independent variables and health-related dependent variables. Clearly defined epidemiological criteria were used to assess the strength of evidence of the selected studies. Twenty-nine studies met the suitability criteria, of which 14 reported healthcare utilisation outcomes; 12 examined mental status outcomes; and 9 reported quality-of-life outcomes. The findings of the review suggest that there is good evidence that housing interventions benefit the homeless population; however more research is needed about housing solutions for individuals with SPMI who are housed, but in precarious or inappropriate housing situations. Study methodologies could be improved by emphasising longitudinal designs that focus on participant retention and by implementing matched control groups or randomised interventions to strengthen internal validity. Ensuring that a person is adequately housed upon discharge from hospital should be a treatment priority. When housing eligibility is not dependent on psychiatric treatment compliance and sobriety, providing permanent housing minimises harm and may free people to voluntarily seek treatment. Housing that offers an unlimited length of stay is recommended because SPMI is a chronic and fluctuating condition that requires stable surroundings to maintain health.

Objective: To evaluate association of a \"Housing First\" intervention for chronically homeless individuals with severe alcohol problems with health care use and costs. Design, Setting, and Participants: Quasi-experimental design comparing 95 housed participants (with drinking permitted) with 39 wait-list control participants enrolled between November 2005 and March 2007 in Seattle, Washington.Main Outcome Measures: Use and cost of services (jail bookings, days incarcerated, shelter and sobering center use, hospital-based medical services, publicly funded alcohol and drug detoxification and treatment, emergency medical services, and Medicaid-funded services) for Housing First participants relative to wait-list controls. Results: Housing First participants had total costs of $8,175,922 in the year prior to the study, or median costs of $4066 per person per month (interquartile range [IQR], $2067-$8264).

Findings: In this economic evaluation study of data from the At Home/Chez Soi randomized clinical trial with 1198 initially homeless participants, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $56.08 per additional day of stable housing. At $67 per day of stable housing, there was an 80% chance that the Housing First intervention with Intensive Case Management was cost-effective compared with treatment as usual. Meaning: Expanding access to Housing First with Intensive Case Management appears to be warranted from an economic point of view. This economic evaluation study investigates the cost-effectiveness of the Housing First intervention with Intensive Case Management compared with treatment as usual among homeless adults with mental illness. Importance: In the At Home/Chez Soi trial for homeless individuals with mental illness, the scattered-site Housing First (HF) with Intensive Case Management (ICM) intervention proved more effective than treatment as usual (TAU). Objective: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the HF plus ICM intervention compared with TAU. Design, Setting, and Participants: This is an economic evaluation study of data from the At Home/Chez Soi randomized clinical trial. From October 2009 through July 2011, 1198 individuals were randomized to the intervention (n = 689) or TAU (n = 509) and followed up for as long as 24 months. Participants were recruited in the Canadian cities of Vancouver, Winnipeg, Toronto, and Montreal. Participants with a current mental disorder who were homeless and had a moderate level of need were included. Data were analyzed from 2013 through 2019, per protocol. Interventions: Scattered-site HF (using rent supplements) with off-site ICM services was compared with usual housing and support services in each city. Main Outcomes and Measures: The analysis was performed from the perspective of society, with days of stable housing as the outcome. Service use was ascertained using questionnaires. Unit costs were estimated in 2016 Canadian dollars. Results: Of 1198 randomized individuals, 795 (66.4%) were men and 696 (58.1%) were aged 30 to 49 years. Almost all (1160 participants, including 677 in the HF group and 483 in the TAU group) contributed data to the economic analysis. Days of stable housing were higher by 140.34 days (95% CI, 128.14-153.31 days) in the HF group. The intervention cost $14 496 per person per year; reductions in costs of other services brought the net cost down by 46% to $7868 (95% CI, $4409-$11 405). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $56.08 (95% CI, $29.55-$84.78) per additional day of stable housing. In sensitivity analyses, adjusting for baseline differences using a regression-based method, without altering the discount rate, caused the largest change in the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio with an increase to $60.18 (95% CI, $35.27-$86.95). At $67 per day of stable housing, there was an 80% chance that HF was cost-effective compared with TAU. The cost-effectiveness of HF appeared to be similar for all participants, although possibly less for those with a higher number of previous psychiatric hospitalizations. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, the cost per additional day of stable housing was similar to that of many interventions for homeless individuals. Based on these results, expanding access to HF with ICM appears to be warranted from an economic standpoint.

The literature evaluating the impact of Housing First on criminal justice involvement has not yet been systematically examined. The objective of this systematic review is to examine the impact of Housing First on criminal justice outcomes among homeless people with mental illness. METHOD: Five electronic databases (PsycINFO, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science) were searched up until July 2018 for randomised and nonrandomised studies of Housing First among homeless people with a serious mental disorder. RESULTS: Five studies were included for a total of 7128 participants. Two studies from a randomised controlled trial found no effect of Housing First on arrests compared to treatment as usual. Other studies compared Housing First to other programs or compared configurations of HF and found reductions in criminal justice involvement among Housing First participants. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review suggests that Housing First, on average, has little impact on criminal justice involvement. Community services such as Housing First are potentially an important setting to put in place strategies to reduce criminal justice involvement. However, forensic mental health approaches such as risk assessment and management strategies and interventions may need to be integrated into existing services to better address potential underlying individual criminogenic risk factors.

The authors conducted a meta-analysis of 44 unique housing alternatives described in 30 studies, which they categorized as residential care and treatment, residential continuum, permanent supported housing, and nonmodel housing. Outcomes examined included housing stability, symptoms, hospitalization, and satisfaction. Methods: Outcome scores were converted to effect size measures appropriate to the data. Effect sizes were combined to estimate random effects for housing models, which were then compared. Results: All models achieved significantly greater housing stability than nonmodel housing. This effect was greatest for permanent supported housing (effect size=.63, p<.05). No differences between housing models were significant. For reduction of psychiatric symptoms, only residential care and treatment differed from nonmodel housing (effect size=.65, p<.05). For hospitalization reduction, both residential care and treatment and permanent supported housing differed from nonmodel housing (p<.05). Permanent supported housing achieved the highest effect size (. 73) for satisfaction and differed from nonmodel housing and residential care and treatment (p<.001 and p<.05, respectively). Conclusions: The meta-analysis provides quantitative evidence that compared with nonmodel housing, housing models contribute to stable housing and other favorable outcomes. The findings also support the theory that different housing models achieve different outcomes for different subgroups. Data were not sufficient to fully answer questions designed to enable program planners and providers to better meet consumers' needs.

Using a partially randomized design, three groups were evaluated: 1) those followed by a therapist and coached to increase healthy behaviors, 2) those followed by a therapist and receiving only emotional support, and 3) those nut followed by a therapist. Survival analyses and nonparametric evaluations were performed. Results: Coached consumers had longer latency to relapse than noncoached and relapsed at a lower rate than those not followed by a therapist. Conclusions and implications for Practice: Therapeutic interventions which focus on increasing healthy behaviors chosen by the consumer can be an important component of sustained recovery from substance dependence.","outcomes":["Capabilities and Wellbeing","Health"],"city":"Dallas","status":"Completed","countryX":"United States","countryY":"United States","stateX":"Texas","stateY":"Texas","quality":"Low quality primary studies"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-96.7969","32.7763"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"E-188","type":"Effectiveness","studyDesign":"Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs)","studyType":"Impact evaluations","title":"Impact of behavioral contingency management intervention on coping behaviors and PTSD symptom reduction in cocaine-addicted homeless","year":"2007","url":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jts.20239","authors":"Lester K M; Milby J B; Schumacher J E; Vuchinich R ; Person S ; Clay O J;","interventionCategories":["Services and outreach","Accommodation and accommodation-based services","Employment","Health and social care"],"populationGroups":["People with complex needs/dual diagnosis"],"abstract":"The purpose of this study was to examine changes in posttrauma symptoms among 118 homeless cocaine-dependent adults participating in a randomly controlled trial studying effective treatments for dually diagnosed homeless individuals.

However, endemic homelessness persists. Multidisciplinary outreach teams that include nursing, social and psychiatric services allow for integrative strategies to engage and support clients on their housing trajectory. The following retrospective review focused on the identification of demographic, clinical, and service characteristics that predicted the obtainment of housing, and explored the role of psychiatric hospitalization as an intervention, not an outcome measure, in contrast to previous studies. These have rarely focused on street homelessness. Method: A retrospective chart review of 85 homeless, primarily rough-sleeping, clients was conducted to determine housing outcomes and the factors associated with obtaining housing through care provided by a psychiatric street outreach team in Toronto, Canada. Demographics, homelessness duration, diagnosis, hospitalization and housing status were tracked during team involvement. Results: Overall, 46% (36/79) were housed during the study term. Securing housing at the end of treatment/data collection was significantly enhanced by hospitalization (OR=9.04, 95% CI [2.43, 33.59]). It was significantly diminished by psychosis (OR=0.22, 95% CI [0.05, 0.95]) and prior homelessness >36months (OR=0.10, 95% CI [0.02, 0.50]). Twenty-three of 31 (74%) hospitalized clients with psychosis were subsequently housed, compared to 4 of 30 (13%) not hospitalized (Fisher's exact, P<.001). Discussion: Multidisciplinary street outreach teams successfully house long-standing homeless clients (>12months without a permanent address) with serious mental illness and/or substance abuse. Hospitalization can be utilized as a complimentary intervention, particularly for those with psychosis, in the continuum of housing first initiatives, and can contribute to securing housing for those with persistent psychotic disorders. Implications for nursing practice Community mental health nurses are uniquely positioned to translate care between hospital and community settings, ensuring timely assessment, intervention and treatment of clients who are historically difficult to engage.","outcomes":["Housing stability"],"city":"Toronto","status":"Completed","countryX":"Canada","countryY":"Canada","stateX":"","stateY":"","quality":"Low quality primary studies"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-79.3849","43.6529"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"E-190","type":"Effectiveness","studyDesign":"Non-experimental design with comparison group","studyType":"Impact evaluations","title":"Reducing AIDS and Substance Abuse Risk Factors among Homeless, HIV-Infected, Drug-Using Persons","year":"2000","url":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/15527581-00010001-05","authors":"Lewis J R; Boyle D P; Lewis L S; Evans M ;","interventionCategories":["Services and outreach","Health and social care"],"populationGroups":["HIV patients","People with alcohol/drug issues"],"abstract":"Investigates the impact of a comprehensive day program of HIV/AIDS (human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome) education, housing support, & 12-step recovery for HIV-infected homeless persons in Atlanta, GA.

A program evaluation of a New York City supportive housing program has assessed the association between supportive housing tenancy and Medicaid savings among New York City housing program applicants with serious mental illness and chronic homelessness or dual diagnoses of mental illness and substance use disorder, stratified by distinctive Medicaid expenditure patterns. METHODS: The evaluation used matched data from administrative records for 2827 people. Sequence analysis identified 6 Medicaid expenditure patterns during 2 years prior to baseline among people placed in the program (n=737) and people eligible but not placed (n=2090), including very low Medicaid coverage, increasing Medicaid expenditure, low, middle, high, and very high Medicaid expenditure patterns. We assessed the impact of the program on Medicaid costs for 2 years post-baseline via propensity score matching and bootstrapping. RESULTS: The housing program was associated with Medicaid savings during 2 years post-baseline (-$9526, 95% CI=-$19,038 to -$2003). Stratified by Medicaid expenditure patterns, Medicaid savings were found among those with very low Medicaid coverage (-$15,694, 95% CI=-$35,926 to -$7983), increasing Medicaid expenditures (-$9020, 95% CI=-$26,753 to -$1705), and high Medicaid expenditure patterns (-$14,450, 95% CI=-$38,232 to -$4454). Savings were largely driven by shorter psychiatric hospitalizations in the post-baseline period among those placed. CONCLUSIONS: The supportive housing program was associated with Medicaid savings, particularly for individuals with very low Medicaid coverage, increasing Medicaid expenditures, and high Medicaid expenditures pre-baseline.","outcomes":["Cost"],"city":"New York","status":"Completed","countryX":"United States","countryY":"United States","stateX":"New York","stateY":"New York","quality":"Medium quality primary studies"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-73.9808","40.7648"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"E-192","type":"Effectiveness","studyDesign":"Non-experimental design with comparison group","studyType":"Impact evaluations","title":"Impact of a Supportive Housing Program on Housing Stability and Sexually Transmitted Infections Among Young Adults in New York City Who Were Aging Out of Foster Care","year":"2017","url":"https://academic.oup.com/aje/article-abstract/186/3/297/3797128","authors":"Lim S ; Singh T P; Gwynn R C;","interventionCategories":["Prevention","Accommodation and accommodation-based services"],"populationGroups":["Young people","People with existing health conditions (excluding HIV)","People leaving social care"],"abstract":"Former foster youth are at increased risk of housing instability and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) during the transitional period following foster care.

Matched administrative records identified 895 former foster youth who were eligible for the housing program during 2007-2010. The main outcomes included housing stability (as determined from episodes of homelessness, incarceration, hospitalization, and residence in supportive housing) and diagnosed STI case rates per 1,000 person-years during the 2 years after baseline.

Three housing stability patterns (unstable housing, stable housing, and rare institutional dwelling patterns) were identified. The housing program was positively associated with a pattern of stable housing (odds ratio = 4.4, 95% confidence interval: 2.9, 6.8), and negatively associated with diagnosed STI rates (relative risk = 0.3, 95% confidence interval: 0.2, 0.7).

In the United States, it is estimated that over a one-year period approximately 700,000 to 2 million people experience homelessness. In addition to the basic needs of shelter, food, and clothing, there are particular psychological barriers to consider for this population. One such obstacle includes the tendency to ruminate over interpersonal offenses. Similar to other populations in crisis, specific strategies and interventions are needed to enhance therapeutic movement and build client resources. The construct of forgiveness has been shown to improve psychological and physical wellbeing, and enhance social functioning. However, homeless individuals may have low levels of forgiveness due in part to the nature of their social environment. The environment of the homeless shelter is one in which interpersonal transgressions are commonplace. When individuals do not directly address the negative emotions resulting from such transgressions, rumination is likely to be maintained. Capacity for forgiveness is lowered as repeated transgressions foster prolonged rumination. In addition, it is likely that many homeless individuals continue to ruminate over transgressions committed against them in their past. To address the psychological distress resulting from both past and current interpersonal transgressions, it was hypothesized that a forgiveness intervention would provide a plausible direction for treatment with this population, as participants would have the opportunity to remediate emotional hurt, improve social connectedness, and learn a new coping strategy for handling future interpersonal transgressions. A group forgiveness intervention with adult male homeless individuals was conducted to investigate if participation would result in decreased rumination, increased forgiveness (offensespecific and likelihood to forgive in the future), and increased social connectedness. Participants were randomly assigned to either the treatment or waitlist control group. Treatment participants attended 4, 2-hour group meetings over the course of a 10-day period for a total of 8 treatment hours. The forgiveness intervention was based on Enright's (2001) model as outlined in Forgiveness is a Choice: A Step-by-Step Process for Resolving Anger and Restoring Hope. A doubly multivariate repeated measures Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was conducted to assess within-group treatment gains from pre to posttest and pretest to one-month follow-up across all 30 treatment participants. Multiple Analyses of Covariance (ANCOVAs) were conducted to assess between-group differences in posttest scores between the initial 16 treatment participants and 16 waitlist controls, while controlling for pretest score on the various measures. The Benjamini-Hochberg procedure was used to correct for inflated alpha level. Results indicated statistically significant increases in offense-specific forgiveness and likelihood to forgive in the future for the treatment participants when compared to the waitlist control group at posttest. In addition, when comparing the treatment participants' scores from pre to posttest and from pretest to one-month follow-up, statistically significant decreases in rumination, and statistically significant increases in offense-specific forgiveness and likelihood to forgive in the future were found. From pretest to one-month follow-up, statistically significant increases were found for social connectedness.

In the United States, homelessness is a problem with multiple and complex causes that include mental illness and the effects of physical, economic, and social conditions such as extreme poverty, exposure to the elements, mental and substance abuse disorders, malnutrition, and victimization. Transitional housing is a temporary option offered as a response to homelessness, recognizing that if individuals are provided with shelter, they may be supported in their attempt to achieve self-sufficiency. There is some evidence that supports the benefits of federally funded transitional housing programs, but to date, few studies have been conducted on faith-based transitional housing programs. These programs often suffer from limited resources and rely instead on providing a faith-based continuum of care to help the homeless achieve independence. This mixed-methods study was designed to examine how one faith-based transitional housing program facility located in Southern California was able to change the attitudes and behaviors of homeless men regarding their lives and their propensity to remain homeless. A pre- and post-survey were administered to 108 homeless men. The men were also observed as they participated in the program activities over a 9 month period. Ten interviews were conducted with a subgroup of those surveyed to explore from their perspective how this faith-based intervention approach supported and/or challenged their recovery. Findings suggest that the attitudes and behaviors of the homeless men who participated in the program were changed, especially those who were in the program for 9 months or more. The majority of the men attributed the change to the faith-based focus of the program. Differences emerged, however, between the men who were in the program for 9 months or more versus those in the program less than 9 months. Nine-month or more participants claimed that they were willing to \"surrender\" their old ways of thinking and living. In contrast, participants less than 9 months were unable to relinquish their former lifestyle. This failure was related to individual pride and/or challenges with addictions. This study provides important lessons for faith-based organizations aiming to develop specific strategies of care that support the needs of homeless men.

Findings show that the RHPP program was successful in significantly reducing new convictions and readmission to prison for new crimes, but had no significant effect on revocations. In addition, results showed that periods of homelessness significantly elevated the risk of recidivism for new convictions, revocations, and readmission to prison. The authors recommend that subsidized housing for high risk offenders become a central part of coordinated responses to reentry.

Overall costs of services use by homeless people can be considerable, suggesting the potential for significant cost offsets with HF programs. Our purpose was to provide an updated literature review, from 2007 to the present, focusing specifically on the cost offsets of HF programs. Method: A systematic review was performed on MEDLINE and PsycINFO as well as Google and the Homeless Hub for grey literature. Study characteristics and key findings were extracted from identified studies. Where available, impact on service cost associated with HF (increase or decrease) and net impact on overall costs, taking into account the cost of HF intervention, were noted Results: Twelve published studies (4 randomized studies and 8 quasi-experimental) and 22 unpublished studies were retained. Shelter and emergency department costs decreased with HF, while impacts on hospitalization and justice costs are more ambiguous. Studies using a pre-post design reported a net decrease in overall costs with HF. In contrast, experimental studies reported a net increase in overall costs with HF. Conclusions: While our review casts doubt on whether HF programs can be expected to pay for themselves, the certainty of significant cost offsets, combined with their benefits for participants, means that they represent a more efficient allocation of resources than traditional services.

Chronically homeless adults with severe alcohol problems are disproportionately burdened with health-care problems and are high utilizers of emergency medical services (EMS). Single-site Housing First (HF), which provides immediate, permanent, low-barrier, nonabstinence-based, supportive housing, has been associated with reduced publicly funded service utilization. The aims of the current study were to determine whether time spent in single-site HF predicted decreases in EMS contacts 2 years subsequent to single-site HF move-in, and to describe medical conditions and injuries associated with EMS contacts in a sample of chronically homeless individuals with severe alcohol problems. Methods. Participants were 91 chronically homeless adults with severe alcohol problems who were enrolled in a single-site HF program between December 2005 and March 2007 in Seattle, Washington. We obtained administrative data on exposure to HF and EMS utilization for the 2 years prior to and the 2 years subsequent to participants' move-in date. EMS utilization variables included patient type (i.e., primary presenting problem), trauma/injury mechanism (i.e., EMS classification of the cause of the trauma or injury), level of care (i.e., basic life support, advanced life support), and transport destination. Results. After controlling for baseline EMS contacts, participants evinced 3% fewer EMS contacts for each additional month of single-site HF exposure. From the baseline to follow-up period, the mean number of EMS contacts declined from 15.85 (SD = 22.96) to 9.54 (SD = 15.08), representing a 54% reduction in the number of EMS contacts. Most calls were responded to by EMTs providing basic life support, and the majority resulted in transport to a local level I trauma center. The most common presenting difficulties were medical illness and trauma. Substance use and psychiatric difficulties were infrequently documented as the primary problem. Conclusions. Our findings support recent assertions that housing is health care and indicate that the amount of time spent in single-site HF is associated with significant reductions in EMS utilization for at least 2 years subsequent to move-in. These findings also underscore the high levels of medical illness and trauma exposure among chronically homeless adults with severe alcohol problems.","outcomes":["Health"],"city":"Seattle","status":"Completed","countryX":"United States","countryY":"United States","stateX":"Washington","stateY":"Washington","quality":"Low quality primary studies"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-122.3301","47.6038"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"E-204","type":"Effectiveness","studyDesign":"Systematic reviews","studyType":"Systematic reviews","title":"Ending street homelessness: What works and why we don’t do it","year":"2019","url":"https://www.usf.edu/cbcs/mhlp/tac/documents/supportive-housing/ending-street-homelessness.pdf","authors":"Mackie P ; Johnsen S ; Wood J ;","interventionCategories":["Services and outreach","Accommodation and accommodation-based services","Financing"],"populationGroups":["Other"],"abstract":"Vast human and financial resources have been spent in efforts to understand and address street homelessness.

It also reflects on the question: ‘if we know what works, why don’t we do it?’ Informed by more than 500 literature sources and interviews with 11 international experts, it identifies the key principles which appear to improve the likelihood of interventions ending street homelessness. These include: be housing-led, offer person-centred support and choice, take swift action, employ assertive outreach leading to a suitable accommodation offer, ensure services address wider support needs, and collaborate effectively between agencies and across sectors. The article also identifies seven reasons why those responding don’t always do what is known to work. If street homelessness is to be ended then we must address: the lack of settled accommodation, funding challenges, ineffective collaboration and commissioning, the needs of different subgroups, ineligibility of some people for publicly funded support,overly bureaucratic processes, and the need for stronger political will.","outcomes":["Crime and justice","Health","Housing stability"],"city":"Cardiff","status":"Completed","countryX":"United Kingdom","countryY":"United Kingdom","stateX":"Wales","stateY":"Wales","quality":"Low quality reviews"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-3.1792","51.4817"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"E-205","type":"Effectiveness","studyDesign":"Before versus after design","studyType":"Impact evaluations","title":"Mindfulness training as a clinical intervention with homeless adults: A pilot study","year":"2017","url":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11469-016-9718-7","authors":"Maddock A ; Hevey D ; Eidenmueller K ;","interventionCategories":["Health and social care"],"populationGroups":["People with/history of mental illness","People with alcohol/drug issues"],"abstract":"The prevalence of mental health and addiction issues in the homeless population is very high.

For example, homeless veterans with mental illness were randomized to receive either case management only, or case management plus special access to a Section 8 housing voucher. However, a quarter of those randomized to the housing voucher group did not actually use the voucher, while a few of those randomized to case management actually used a housing voucher. Our goal is to estimate the causal effect of the proposed active ingredient (i.e., using a housing voucher), as opposed to the effect of being randomized to the active ingredient. The proposed instrumental variable methodology assumes that the outcome is proportional to the dose of the active ingredient and tests the significance of the instrumental variable estimate using a permutation test such as the Hodges–Lehman aligned rank statistic proposed by Rosenbaum for pair-matched data (Rosenbaum, Observational studies, 2002; The design of observational studies, 2010). This method removes unmeasured confounding when the assumptions of monotonicity and the exclusion restrictions hold; however, in practice these assumptions may not hold perfectly. Consequently, we extend and strengthen this approach by incorporating optimal full matching on the propensity to use the active ingredient, to further reduce bias and variability in the IV estimation.","outcomes":["Housing stability"],"city":"Cleveland","status":"Completed","countryX":"United States","countryY":"United States","stateX":"Ohio","stateY":"Ohio","quality":"Low quality primary studies"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-81.6934","41.5052"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"E-208","type":"Effectiveness","studyDesign":"Before versus after design","studyType":"Impact evaluations","title":"A comparison of treatment outcomes among chronically homelessness adults receiving comprehensive housing and health care services versus usual local care","year":"2011","url":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10488-011-0333-4","authors":"Mares AS ; Robert RA ;","interventionCategories":["Services and outreach","Accommodation and accommodation-based services"],"populationGroups":["People with/history of mental illness","People with alcohol/drug issues","People with existing health conditions (excluding HIV)"],"abstract":"","outcomes":["Cost","Employment and income","Health","Housing stability"],"city":"Chattanooga","status":"Completed","countryX":"United States","countryY":"United States","stateX":"Tennessee","stateY":"Tennessee","quality":"Low quality primary studies"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-85.3097","35.0456"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"E-209","type":"Effectiveness","studyDesign":"Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs)","studyType":"Impact evaluations","title":"Development and Piloting of a Just-in-Time, Personalized HIV Prevention Intervention for Youth Experiencing Homelessness and Unstable Housing","year":"2019","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03911024","authors":"Maria D S;","interventionCategories":["Health and social care"],"populationGroups":["Young people"],"abstract":"The purpose of this study is develop and pilot test a personalized HIV intervention with youth experiencing homelessness by creating and field testing prevention messages that address real-time predictors (e.g., sexual urge, use to use drugs, and substance use) of HIV risk behaviors,to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and to evaluate the intervention outcome effects on HIV risk behaviors (e.g., condomless sex, number of sexual partners, pre-exposure prophylaxis(PrEP) awareness, substance use during sex,Intravenous(IV)drug use)","outcomes":["Health"],"city":"Austin","status":"Completed","countryX":"United States","countryY":"United States","stateX":"Texas","stateY":"Texas","quality":"Low quality primary studies"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-97.7437","30.2711"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"E-210","type":"Effectiveness","studyDesign":"Non-experimental design with comparison group","studyType":"Impact evaluations","title":"Impacts of Heading Home Hennepin's Housing First programs for long-term homeless adults","year":"2011","url":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10511482.2011.594076?scroll=top&needAccess=true","authors":"Maria H ;","interventionCategories":["Accommodation and accommodation-based services"],"populationGroups":["People with disabilities"],"abstract":"","outcomes":["Crime and justice","Health","Housing stability"],"city":"Hennepin County","status":"Completed","countryX":"United States","countryY":"United States","stateX":"Minnesota","stateY":"Minnesota","quality":"Low quality primary studies"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-93.266667","44.975833"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"E-211","type":"Effectiveness","studyDesign":"Before versus after design","studyType":"Impact evaluations","title":"Alternative Care to the Accompaniment Called \"Place of Respite\" in the Resolution of the Psychotic Crises of Homeless People With Severe Mental Pathology","year":"2019","url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03992105","authors":"Marseille P H D;","interventionCategories":["Health and social care"],"populationGroups":["People with/history of mental illness"],"abstract":"Document the effectiveness of the \"Respite Site\" program in relation to the current health system.

The case-management approach has been widely accepted, to the extent that recent legislation has made case-management the cornerstone of community care in the UK. We did a randomised controlled trial to evaluate a social services case-management team for people with long-term mental disorders. Subjects were referred from hostels for the homeless, night shelters, a general-practitioner clinic for the homeless, the Oxford City Council homelessness unit, and local voluntary-sector group homes. Of 103 subjects referred, 80 consented to be randomised to treatment or control groups. At 14-month follow-up, as assessed by standardised interviews, there were no significant differences between groups in number of needs, quality of life, employment status, quality of accommodation, social behaviour, or severity of psychiatric symptoms. In the case-management group there was a significant reduction in deviant behaviour on a standardised behaviour rating scale (REHAB) (mean = 0.79; 95% CI 0.26-1.32).

The present study examined the effect of direct and indirect ratings of working alliance on concurrent and longer-term health outcomes, and measured the moderating impact of racial and age matching between clients and their case managers on the effect of working alliance. This study represented a secondary data analysis of a case management intervention for homeless mothers with addictive disorders. Cases were selected for this investigation if they reported having a case manager at a baseline assessment and if demographic characteristics had been collected on their primary case manager (n=90). Working alliance ratings, demographics, physical health, mental health, and substance-use outcomes were collected at baseline, as well as 3-month, 9-month, and 15-month interviews. Relationships between baseline variables and the working alliances were analyzed, as well as the effect of the working alliance on health outcomes over time. Finally, the moderating effect of racial and age matching was considered. The overall effect of working alliance by itself on subsequent physical and mental health and substance use outcomes was negligible. However, the interaction between age and racial matching with working alliance appeared to influence clients' health outcomes over time. In racially matched dyads, high direct working alliance was associated with self-reported improvements in overall physical health as well as for more specific components of physical health (i.e., role limitations and vitality). When clients and case managers were age-matched, low indirect working alliance ratings were associated with better substance abuse outcomes, and when racially matched, better social functioning. This contrast between the direct and indirect measures as well as the key importance of the interaction effects, indicate a need to examine working alliance ratings in the context of the role of race and age matching between clients and case managers for women who have physical health, mental health, or substance use concerns. These findings have important implications for programs seeking to help homeless mothers with addictive disorders to help manage and improve their physical health, mental health, and substance use.

A total of 37 therapeutic community program participants at Austin Street Centre (ASC), a homeless shelter in Dallas, Texas, were compared across time to an approximately matched, no-treatment comparison group (N = 37), who utilized only basic shelter services. The groups were evaluated at baseline and compared at six-week and three-month follow-ups. Due to greater ease in tracking program participants, the therapeutic community program group (TCPG) was followed over a longer period of time, with additional evaluations occurring at six months and one year. All participants were compared on psychiatric symptoms, social functioning, and substance abuse, whereas an additional measure was administered to the TCPG to evaluate their work performance within the program. It was expected that the TCPG would show significant change across time and when compared to the CG on all outcome measures. As predicted, the TCPG demonstrated significant within-group and between-group improvements in overall distress, psychiatric symptoms, and substance abuse. Improvements in social functioning were exhibited in the TCPG at later follow-up time periods, when participants received treatment for a longer period of time. The CG did not evidence significant improvement in any of the aforementioned domains. Given the high attrition rate among the homeless, retention rates and outcome were also investigated. The retention rate was higher in the TCPG at three-month follow-up when compared to the CG. Analysis of outcome among drop-outs revealed that a greater number of the TCPG participants experienced a positive outcome upon departure from the program than those who dropped out of the CG. Future research will need to determine what factors contribute to greater retention in the therapeutic community. With greater retention and completion of the therapeutic community program, it is likely that more homeless individuals would experience the full range of benefits that a comprehensive treatment modality such as a therapeutic community can offer. These benefits range from more immediate symptom reduction to longer term improvements in social/occupational functioning that can herald a more fulfilling, affiliated life in the larger community.

Plain Language Summary Interventions to reduce homelessness and improve housing stability are effective There are large numbers of homeless people around the world. Interventions to address homelessness seem to be effective, though better quality evidence is required. What is this review about? There are large numbers of homeless people around the world. Recent estimates are over 500,000 people in the USA, 100,000 in Australia and 30,000 in Sweden. Efforts to combat homelessness have been made on national levels as well as at local government levels. This review assesses the effectiveness of interventions combining housing and case management as a means to reduce homelessness and increase residential stability for individuals who are homeless, or at risk of becoming homeless. What is the aim of this review? This Campbell systematic review examines the effectiveness of interventions to reduce homelessness and increase residential stability for individuals who are homeless, or at risk of becoming homeless. Forty-three studies were included in the review, 37 of which are from the USA. What studies are included? Included studies were randomized controlled trials of interventions for individuals who were already, or at-risk of becoming, homeless, and which measured impact on homelessness or housing stability with follow-up of at least one year. A total of 43 studies were included. The majority of the studies (37) were conducted in the United States, with three from the United Kingdom and one each from Australia, Canada, and Denmark. What are the main findings of this review? Included interventions perform better than the usual services at reducing homelessness or improving housing stability in all comparisons. These interventions are: High intensity case management Housing First Critical time intervention Abstinence-contingent housing Non-abstinence-contingent housing with high intensity case management Housing vouchers Residential treatment These interventions seem to have similar beneficial effects, so it is unclear which of these is best with respect to reducing homelessness and increasing housing stability. What do the findings of this review mean? A range of housing programs and case management interventions appear to reduce homelessness and improve housing stability, compared to usual services. However, there is uncertainty in this finding as most the studies have risk of bias due to poor reporting, lack of blinding, or poor randomization or allocation concealment of participants. In addition to the general need for better conducted and reported studies, there are specific gaps in the research with respect to: 1) disadvantaged youth; 2) abstinence-contingent housing with case management or day treatment; 3) non-abstinence contingent housing comparing group vs independent living; 4) Housing First compared to interventions other than usual services, and; 5) studies outside of the USA. How up-to-date is this review? The review authors searched for studies published up to January 2016. This Campbell systematic review was published in February 2018. Executive summary Background The United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights (Article 25) states that everyone has a right to housing. However, this right is far from being realized for many people worldwide. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), there are approximately 100 million homeless people worldwide. The aim of this report is to contribute evidence to inform future decision making and practice for preventing and reducing homelessness. Objectives To identify, appraise and summarize the evidence on the effectiveness of housing programs and case management to improve housing stability and reduce homelessness among people who are homeless or at-risk of becoming homeless. Search methods We conducted a systematic review in accordance with the Norwegian Knowledge Centre's handbook. We systematically searched for literature in relevant databases and conducted a grey literature search which was last updated in January 2016. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials that included individuals who were already, or at-risk of becoming, homeless were included if they examined the effectiveness of relevant interventions on homelessness or housing stability. There were no limitations regarding language, country or length of homelessness. Two reviewers screened 2,918 abstracts and titles for inclusion. They read potentially relevant references in full, and included relevant studies in the review. Data collection and analysis We pooled the results and conducted meta-analyses when possible. Our certainty in the primary outcomes was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation for effectiveness approach (GRADE). Results We included 43 relevant studies (described in 78 publications) that examined the effectiveness of housing programs and/or case management services on homelessness and/or housing stability. The results are summarized below. Briefly, we found that the included interventions performed better than the usual services in all comparisons. However, certainty in the findings varied from very low to moderate. Most of the studies were assessed as having high risk of bias due to poor reporting, lack of blinding, or poor randomization and/or allocation concealment of participants. Case management Case management is a process where clients are assigned case managers who assess, plan and facilitate access to health and social services necessary for the client's recovery. The intensity of these services can vary. One specific model is Critical time intervention, which is based on the same principles, but offered in three three-month periods that decrease in intensity. High intensity case management compared to usual services has generally more positive effects: It probably reduces the number of individuals who are homeless after 12-18 months by almost half (RR=0.59, 95%CI=0.41 to 0.87)(moderate certainty evidence); It may increase the number of people living in stable housing after 12-18 months and reduce the number of days an individual spends homeless (low certainty evidence), however; it may have no effect on the number of individuals who experience some homelessness during a two year period (low certainty evidence). When compared to low intensity case management, it may have little or no effect on time spent in stable housing (low certainty evidence). Critical time intervention compared to usual services may 1) have no effect on the number of people who experience homelessness, 2) lead to fewer days spent homeless, 3) lead to more days spent not homeless and, 4) reduce the amount of time it takes to move from shelter to independent housing (low certainty evidence). Abstinence-contingent housing programs Abstinence-contingent housing is housing provided with the expectation that residents will remain sober. The results showed that abstinence-contingent housing may lead to fewer days spent homeless, compared with usual services (low certainty evidence). Non-abstinence-contingent housing programs Non-abstinence-contingent housing is housing provided with no expectations regarding sobriety of residents. Housing First is the name of one specific non-abstinence-contingent housing program. When compared to usual services Housing First probably reduces the number of days spent homeless (MD=-62.5, 95%CI=-86.86 to -38.14) and increases the number of days in stable housing (MD=110.1, 95%CI=93.05 to 127.15) (moderate certainty evidence). In addition, it may increase the number of people placed in permanent housing after 20 months (low certainty evidence). Non-abstinence-contingent housing programs (not specified as Housing First) in combination with high intensity case management may reduce homelessness, compared to usual services (low certainty evidence). Group living arrangements may be better than individual apartments at reducing homelessness (low certainty evidence). Housing vouchers with case management Housing vouchers is a housing allowance given to certain groups of people who qualify. The results showed that it mayreduce homelessness and improve housing stability, compared with usual services or case management (low certainty evidence). Residential treatment with case management Residential treatment is a type of housing offered to clients who also need treatment for mental illness or substance abuse. We found that it mayreduce homelessness and improve housing stability, compared with usual services (low certainty evidence). Authors? conclusions We found that a range of housing programs and case management interventions appear to reduce homelessness and improve housing stability, compared to usual services. The findings showed no indication of housing programs or case management resulting in poorer outcomes for homeless or at-risk individuals than usual services. Aside from a general need for better conducted and reported studies, there are specific gaps in the research. We identified research gaps concerning: 1)Disadvantaged youth; 2) Abstinence-contingent housing with case management or day treatment; 3) Non-abstinence contingent housing, specifically different living arrangements (group vs independent living); 4) Housing First compared to interventions other than usual services, and; 5) All interventions from contexts other than the USA.","outcomes":["Housing stability"],"city":"Oslo","status":"Completed","countryX":"Norway","countryY":"Norway","stateX":"","stateY":"","quality":"High quality reviews"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["10.746","59.912"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"E-238","type":"Effectiveness","studyDesign":"Non-experimental design with comparison group","studyType":"Impact evaluations","title":"Long-term outcomes of disability benefits in US veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder","year":"2011","url":"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/1107426","authors":"Murdoch M ; Sayer N A; Spoont M R; Rosenheck R ; Noorbaloochi S ; Griffin J M; Arbisi P A; Hagel E M;","interventionCategories":["Prevention"],"populationGroups":["Veterans/Ex-services"],"abstract":"CONTEXT: Most studies examining the clinical impact of disability benefits have compared aid recipients with people who never applied for benefits. Such practices may bias findings against recipients because disability applicants tend to be much sicker than never-applicants. Furthermore, these studies ignore the outcomes of denied claimants. OBJECTIVE: To examine long-term outcomes associated with receiving or not receiving Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) disability benefits for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), the most common mental disorder for which veterans seek such benefits. DESIGN: Comparison of outcomes between successful and unsuccessful applicants for VA disability payments. Because we could not randomize the receipt of benefits, we used exact matching by propensity scores to control for potential baseline differences. We examined clinical outcomes approximately 10 years later. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Stratified, nationally representative cohort of 3337 veterans who applied for VA PTSD disability benefits between January 1, 1994, and December 31, 1998. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Assessment on validated survey measures of PTSD; work, role, social, and physical functioning; employment; and poverty. We compared outcomes with earlier scores. Homelessness and mortality were assessed using administrative data. RESULTS: Of still-living cohort members, 85.1% returned usable surveys. Symptoms of PTSD were elevated in both groups. After adjustment, awardees had more severe PTSD symptoms than denied claimants but were nonetheless more likely to have had a meaningful symptom reduction since their last assessment (-6.1 vs -4.4; SE, 0.1; P = .01). Both groups had meaningful improvements of similar magnitude in work, role, and social functioning (-0.15 vs -0.19; SE, 0.01; P = .94), but functioning remained poor nonetheless. Comparing awardees with denied claimants after adjustment, 13.2% vs 19.0% were employed (P = .11); 15.2% vs 44.8% reported poverty (P < .001); 12.0% vs 20.0% had been homeless (P = .02); and 10.4% vs 9.7% had died (P = .66). CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of claim outcome, veterans who apply for PTSD disability benefits are highly impaired. However, receiving PTSD benefits was associated with clinically meaningful reductions in PTSD symptoms and less poverty and homelessness.","outcomes":["Capabilities and Wellbeing","Employment and income","Health"],"city":"Minneapolis","status":"Completed","countryX":"United States","countryY":"United States","stateX":"Minnesota","stateY":"Minnesota","quality":"Medium quality primary studies"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-93.2655","44.9773"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"E-239","type":"Effectiveness","studyDesign":"Before versus after design","studyType":"Impact evaluations","title":"The Effects of the ACA Medicaid Expansion on Nationwide Home Evictions and Eviction-Court Initiations: United States, 2000–2016","year":"2019","url":"https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.2019.305230","authors":"Naomi Z ; Erica E ; Heidi A ; Tal G ;","interventionCategories":["Legislation"],"populationGroups":["Ex-prisoners"],"abstract":"Objectives. To evaluate the effect of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) Medicaid expansions on national rates of home eviction and eviction initiation in the United States. Methods. Using nationally representative administrative data from The Eviction Lab at Princeton University, we estimated the effects of the ACA Medicaid expansions on county-level evictions and filings from 2000 to 2016 with a difference-in-difference regression design. Results. We found that Medicaid expansions were associated with an annual reduction in the rate of evictions by 1.15 per 1000 renter-occupied households (P <.001), a reduction of 1.59 eviction filings per 1000 renter-occupied households (P <.001), and a reduction in the average number of evictions by 46 (P <.05). We found additional evidence that increasing rates of African American residents in a county was associated with a greater rate of evictions filed, and increased rates of poverty and rent burdens relative to income were associated with more evictions both filed and completed. Conclusions. Evictions decreased after Medicaid expansion, demonstrating further evidence of the substantive financial protections afforded by this coverage. The reduction in the eviction filing rate suggests that Medicaid expansion could be reducing evictions by preventing the court proceeding entirely.","outcomes":["Housing stability"],"city":"New York","status":"Completed","countryX":"United States","countryY":"United States","stateX":"New York","stateY":"New York","quality":"Medium quality primary studies"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-73.9808","40.7648"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"E-240","type":"Effectiveness","studyDesign":"Systematic reviews","studyType":"Systematic reviews","title":"Interventions to modify sexual risk behaviours for preventing HIV in homeless youth","year":"2011","url":"https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD007501.pub2/abstract","authors":"Naranbhai V ; Karim Q A; Meyer‐Weitz A ;","interventionCategories":["Services and outreach"],"populationGroups":["Young people","People with alcohol/drug issues"],"abstract":"BACKGROUND: Homeless youth are at high risk for HIV infection as a consequence of risky sexual behaviour. Interventions for homeless youth are challenging. Assessment of the effectiveness of interventions to modify sexual risk behaviours for preventing HIV in homeless youth is needed. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate and summarize the effectiveness of interventions for modifying sexual risk behaviours and preventing transmission of HIV among homeless youth. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched electronic databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, AIDSearch, Gateway, PsycInfo, LILACS), reference lists of eligible articles, international health agency publication lists, and clinical trial registries. The search was updated January 2010. We contacted authors of published reports and other key role players. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised studies of interventions to modify sexual risk behaviour (biological, self-reporting of sexual-risk behaviour or health-seeking behaviour) in homeless youth (12-24 years). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data from eligible studies were extracted by two reviewers. We assessed risk of bias per the Cochrane Collaborations tool. None of the eligible studies reported any primary biological outcomes for this review. Reports of self-reporting sexual risk behaviour outcomes varied across studies precluding calculation of summary measures of effect; we present the outcomes descriptively for each study. We contacted authors for missing or ambiguous data. MAIN RESULTS: We identified three eligible studies after screening a total of 255 unique records. All three were performed in the United States of America and recruited substance-abusing male and female adolescents (total N=615) through homeless shelters into randomised controlled trials of independent and non-overlapping behavioural interventions. The three trials differed in theoretical background, delivery method, dosage (number of sessions,) content and outcome assessments. Overall, the variability in delivery and outcomes precluded estimation of summary of effect measures. We assessed the risk of bias to be high for each of the studies. Whilst some effect of the interventions on outcome measures were reported, heterogeneity and lack of robustness in these studies necessitate caution in interpreting the effectiveness of these interventions. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The body of evidence does not permit conclusions on the impact of interventions to modify sexual risk behaviour in homeless youth; more research is required. While the psychosocial and contextual factors that fuel sexual risk behaviours among homeless youth challenge stringent methodologies of RCT's, novel ways for program delivery and trial retention are in need of development. Future trials should comply with rigorous methodology in design, delivery, outcome measurement and reporting.","outcomes":["Health"],"city":"New York","status":"Completed","countryX":"United States","countryY":"United States","stateX":"New York","stateY":"New York","quality":"High quality reviews"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-73.9808","40.7648"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"E-241","type":"Effectiveness","studyDesign":"Before versus after design","studyType":"Impact evaluations","title":"Moving Ahead: Evaluation of a Work-Skills Training Program for Homeless Adults","year":"2012","url":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10597-012-9490-5","authors":"Nelson S E; Gray H M; Maurice I R; Shaffer H J;","interventionCategories":["Services and outreach","Employment"],"populationGroups":["Ex-prisoners","People with/history of mental illness","People with alcohol/drug issues"],"abstract":"This study examines the impact of a work-skills program grounded in an integrated services approach on both employment and related life domains among homeless individuals.

Ages ranged from 18 to 50 years.INTERVENTIONS: The baseline instrument was a 45-minute interview, which occurred in a private room in the shelters, administered to the women and their intimate partners. All women and their partners were offered HIV pretest and posttest counseling, had blood drawn for HIV antibody testing, provided a urine sample for drug testing, and received a list of available community resources. Women and their intimate partners in the nurse case-managed program engaged in a 2-hour session weekly for 6 weeks. The couples received information on HIV/AIDS, risk behaviors, and risk-reducing behaviors. Women and their intimate partners assigned to the peer-mentored program received the same intervention as those in the nurse case-managed program, except that the role of the nurse was assumed by a female peer mentor who matched the participants' ethnicity. Those assigned to the standard care program were administered the instrument packet by the research staff and received a standard traditional 15-min HIV antibody pretest as well as posttest counseling. The Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory (SEI), the Mental Health Index (MHI-5), the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) and the revised Drug History Form were all administered.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Except for self-esteem, significant improvements in all cognitive, psychological, and behavioral factors were observed in all three HIV risk-reduction programs, supporting the theoretical framework that culturally competent AIDS education can exert a direct influence on a number of outcome variables. However, differential program effects were found for self-esteem, as well as for being highly knowledgeable about AIDS and for depression and hostility. The standard care approach effectively modified HIV risk behaviors for a majority of the homeless participants.RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: In addition to suggesting ways of helping to prevent the spread of HIV, our results suggest that overall psychological well-being can be improved through concerted efforts directed toward this vulnerable population.

Ability to complete an HBV vaccination series is complicated by the need to prioritize competing needs, such as addiction issues, safe places to sleep, and food, over health concerns. Objectives: The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effectiveness of a nurse-case-managed intervention compared with that of two standard programs on completion of the combined hepatitis A virus (HAV) and HBV vaccine series among homeless adults and to assess sociodemographic factors and risk behaviors related to the vaccine completion. Methods: A randomized, three-group, prospective, quasi-experimental design was conducted with 865 homeless adults residing in homeless shelters, drug rehabilitation sites, and outdoor areas in the Skid Row area of Los Angeles. The programs included (a) nurse-case-managed sessions plus targeted hepatitis education, incentives, and tracking (NCMIT); (b) standard targeted hepatitis education plus incentives and tracking (SIT); and (c) standard targeted hepatitis education and incentives only (SI). Results: Sixty-eight percent of the NCMIT participants completed the three-series vaccine at 6 months, compared with 61% of SIT participants and 54% of SI participants. NCMIT participants had almost 2 times greater odds of completing vaccination than those of participants in the SI program. Completers were more likely to be older, to be female, to report fair or poor health, and not to have participated in a self-help drug treatment program. Newly homeless White adults were significantly less likely than were African Americans to complete the vaccine series. Discussion: The use of vaccination programs incorporating nurse case management and tracking is critical in supporting adherence to completion of a 6-month HAV/HBV vaccine. The finding that White homeless persons were the least likely to complete the vaccine series suggests that programs tailored to address their unique cultural issues are needed.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a validated nurse case-managed intervention with incentives and tracking would improve adherence to latent tuberculosis infection treatment in subsamples of homeless persons with characteristics previously identified in the literature as predictive of nonadherence. METHODS: A prospective 2-group site-randomized design was conducted with 520 homeless adults residing in 12 homeless shelters and residential recovery sites in the Skid Row region of Los Angeles from 1998 to 2003. RESULTS: Daily drug use rs, participants with a history of injection drug use, daily alcohol users, and persons who were not of African American race or ethnicity had particularly poor completion rates, even in the nurse case-managed intervention program (48%, 55%, 54%, and 50%, respectively). However, the intervention achieved a 91% completion rate for homeless shelter residents and significantly improved latent tuberculosis infection treatment adherence in 9 of 12 subgroups tested (odds ratios = 2.51-10.41), including daily alcohol and drug users, when potential confounders were controlled using logistic regression analysis. DISCUSSION: Nurse case management with incentives appears to be a good foundation for increasing adherence to 6-month isoniazid treatment in a variety of homeless subgroups and, in particular, for sheltered homeless populations. However, additional social-structural and environmental strategies are needed to address those at greatest risk of nonadherence.","outcomes":["Capabilities and Wellbeing","Health"],"city":"Los Angeles","status":"Completed","countryX":"United States","countryY":"United States","stateX":"California","stateY":"California","quality":"Low quality primary studies"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-118.2439","34.0544"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"E-248","type":"Effectiveness","studyDesign":"Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs)","studyType":"Impact evaluations","title":"Nursing Case Management, Peer Coaching, and Hepatitis A and B Vaccine Completion Among Homeless Men Recently Released on Parole: Randomized Clinical","year":"2015","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4418035/","authors":"Nyamathi A ; Salem B E; Zhang S ; Farabee D ; Hall B ; Khalilifard F ; Leake B ;","interventionCategories":["Prevention","Services and outreach","Education and skills"],"populationGroups":["Ex-prisoners"],"abstract":"Although hepatitis A virus (HAV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections are vaccine-preventable diseases, few homeless parolees coming out of prisons and jails have received the hepatitis A and B vaccination series. The study focused on completion of the HAV and HBV vaccine series among homeless men on parole. The efficacy of three levels of peer coaching (PC) and nurse-delivered interventions was compared at 12-month follow-up: (a) intensive peer coaching and nurse case management (PC-NCM); (b) intensive PC intervention condition, with minimal nurse involvement; and (c) usual care (UC) intervention condition, which included minimal PC and nurse involvement. Furthermore, we assessed predictors of vaccine completion among this targeted sample. A randomized control trial was conducted with 600 recently paroled men to assess the impact of the three intervention conditions (PC-NCM vs. PC vs. UC) on reducing drug use and recidivism; of these, 345 seronegative, vaccine-eligible subjects were included in this analysis of completion of the Twinrix HAV/HBV vaccine. Logistic regression was added to assess predictors of completion of the HAV/HBV vaccine series and chi-square analysis to compare completion rates across the three levels of intervention. Vaccine completion rate for the intervention conditions were 75.4% (PC-NCM), 71.8% (PC), and 71.9% (UC; p = .78). Predictors of vaccine noncompletion included being Asian and Pacific Islander, experiencing high levels of hostility, positive social support, reporting a history of injection drug use, being released early from California prisons, and being admitted for psychiatric illness.

Objective: The purpose of the study was to compare the effect of a dialectical behavioral therapy-case management (DBT-CM) program with a health promotion (HP) program on achieving drug and alcohol abstinence among female parolees/probationers residing in the community. Methods: We conducted amulticenter parallel randomized controlled trial with 130 female parolees/probationers (aged 19-64 years) residing in the community randomly assigned to either DBT-CM (n = 65) or HP (n = 65). The trial was conducted in four community-based partner sites in Los Angeles and Pomona, California, from February 2015 to November 2016. Treatment assignment was carried out using a computer-based urn randomization program. The primary outcome was drug and alcohol use abstinence at 6-month follow up. Results: Analysis was based on data from 116 participants with complete outcome data. Multivariable logistic regression revealed that the DBT-CM program remained an independent positive predictor of decrease in drug use among the DBT-CM participants at 6 months (p = .01) as compared with the HP program participants. Being non-White (p < .05) and having higher depressive symptom scores (p < .05) were associated with lower odds of drug use abstinence (i.e., increased the odds of drug use) at 6 months.

Methods: The purpose of this study was to primarily ascertain how different levels of intensity in peer coaching and nurse-partnered intervention programs may impact reentry outcomes; specifically: (a) an intensive peer coach and nurse case managed (PC-NCM) program; (b) an intermediate peer coaching (PC) program with brief nurse counseling; and (c) the usual care (UC) program involving limited peer coaching and brief nurse counseling. Secondary outcomes evaluated the operational cost of each program. Results: When compared to baseline, all three groups made progress on key health-related outcomes during the 12-month intervention period; further, 84.5 % of all participants eligible for hepatitis A/B vaccination completed their vaccine series. The results of the detailed operational cost analysis suggest the least costly approach (i.e., UC), which accounted for only 2.11 % of the total project expenditure, was as effective in achieving comparable outcomes for this parolee population as the PC-NCM and PC approaches, which accounted for 53.98 % and 43.91 %, respectively, of the project budget.

This study examined data from an experimental trial of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development-Veterans Affairs Supported Housing (HUD-VASH) program to identify differences in the program's impact on subgroups defined by sociodemographic or clinical characteristics. METHODS: Data were analyzed from 259 male homeless veterans with substance abuse problems who were randomly assigned to HUD-VASH (intensive case management [ICM] plus rent subsidy vouchers), ICM only, or treatment as usual between June 1992 and December 1995. Four subgroups were defined: African American versus Caucasian, younger versus older than 42.3 years, co-occurring diagnoses of mental illness versus diagnosis of a substance use disorder only, and active versus less active substance use upon program entry. Mixed models were used to identify significant interactions between HUD-VASH assignment and each subgroup. RESULTS: Compared with ICM alone, HUD-VASH was associated with more positive housing outcomes for Caucasians, veterans with co-occurring mental disorders, and veterans who were active substance users. HUD-VASH was associated with more positive socioclinical outcomes for African Americans. No differences were observed in housing or socioclinical outcomes as a function of age. CONCLUSIONS: Among homeless veterans with a substance use disorder, Caucasians and those with active substance use showed greater housing benefits than other veterans from HUD-VASH than from ICM alone. African Americans showed greater socioclinical benefit than Caucasians from HUD-VASH versus ICM.

However, engaging them in primary and mental health care services is often elusive and difficult to achieve. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to increase health-seeking behavior and receipt of health care among homeless Veterans. DESIGN: This was a multi-center, prospective, community-based, two-by-two randomized controlled trial of homeless Veterans. PARTICIPANTS: Homeless Veterans not receiving primary care participated in the study. INTERVENTIONS: An outreach intervention that included a personal health assessment and brief intervention (PHA/BI), and/or a clinic orientation (CO) was implemented. MAIN MEASURE: We measured receipt of primary care within 4 weeks of study enrollment. KEY RESULTS: Overall, 185 homeless Veterans were enrolled: the average age was 48.6 years (SD 10.8), 94.6 % were male, 43.0 % were from a minority population, 12.0 % were unsheltered, 25.5 % were staying in a dusk-to-dawn emergency shelter, 26.1 % were in transitional housing, while 27.7 % were in an unstable, doubled-up arrangement. At one month, 77.3 % of the PHA/BI plus CO group accessed primary care and by 6 months, 88.7 % had been seen in primary care. This was followed by the CO-only group, 50.0 % of whom accessed care in the first 4 weeks, the PHI/BI-only arm at 41.0 % and the Usual Care arm at 30.6 %. Chi-squared tests by group were significant (p < 0.001) at both 4 weeks and 6 months. There was no difference in attitudes about care at baseline and 6 months or in use patterns once enrolled in care.

A group of these mothers was given a six hour maternal health literacy training, and a survey was administered before and after the training. Due to the small sample size and the transient population, there is a chance that the data may not be robust enough to substantiate our expectation to establish short-term benefits of the training, so an additional questionnaire was given to several women who were still in the program a few months after the training. The anticipation is that enough data will prove the benefits of the maternal health literacy training in order to move forward with the implementation of a more consistent health literacy training program for this population of women wherever they may be.

We, therefore, examined the relationship between substance use and residential stability among homeless adults with current mental disorders who participated in The Vancouver At Home study. METHODS: The Vancouver At Home study is part of a multi-site pragmatic, randomized controlled trial of a Housing First intervention among homeless individuals with mental illness in five Canadian cities. Participants were eligible if they were 19 years of age or over, met criteria for a current mental disorder on the MINI 6.0 Neuropsychiatric Interview, and were absolutely homeless or precariously housed. We used the Residential Time-Line Follow Back Inventory to derive our primary outcome variable, residential stability, which we defined as the number of days in stable residences after randomization up to their 12 months visit. Substance dependence was identified at baseline using the MINI 6.0. At baseline self-reported frequency of substance use over the past month was captured using the Maudsley Addiction Profile. We dichotomized frequency of substance use to capture daily substance use versus less than daily or none; this variable was used to reflect severity of substance use and its potential impact on daily function. Mental health symptoms and severity were collected through the Colorado Symptom Index. Two negative binomial regression models were fit to examine independent association between the residential stability and the primary independent variables substance dependence and daily substance use. RESULTS: A total sample of 497 participants were recruited between October 2009 and June 2011 with 58 % (N=288) meeting criteria for substance dependence and 29 % (N=143) reporting daily substance use. The follow-up rate at 1 year was 96 %. There was no difference in the number of days stably housed by substance dependence (182.1 versus 185.6 days, p=0.787). We found no significant association between substance dependence and residential stability (Adjusted IRR 0.94; 95 % CI 0.68-1.30) or between daily substance use and residential stability (Adjusted IRR 0.86; 95 % CI 0.61-1.22) after adjusting for the type of housing intervention, employment, sociodemographics and mental health. CONCLUSIONS: People with mental disorders may achieve similar levels of housing stability from Housing First regardless of whether they experience concurrent substance dependence. In contrast to some interventions for homeless persons, HF does not require abstinence from drugs among clients. These findings raise important questions regarding the role and relevance of patient choice in the context of health service delivery and program design.","outcomes":["Health","Housing stability"],"city":"Vancouver","status":"Completed","countryX":"Canada","countryY":"Canada","stateX":"","stateY":"","quality":"High quality primary studies"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-123.1139","49.2609"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"E-267","type":"Effectiveness","studyDesign":"Non-experimental design with comparison group","studyType":"Impact evaluations","title":"Does emergency financial assistance reduce crime?","year":"2019","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S004727271830210X#:~:text=In%20theory%2C%20emergency%20financial%20assistance,income%20transfer%20would%20decrease%20crime.","authors":"Palmer C ; Phillips DC ; Sullivan JX ;","interventionCategories":["Prevention"],"populationGroups":["Young people","Families with children"],"abstract":"To address this question, we exploit quasi-random variation in the allocation of temporary financial assistance to eligible individuals and families that have experienced an economic shock. Chicago's Homelessness Prevention Call Center (HPCC) connects such families and individuals with assistance, but the availability of funding varies unpredictably. Consequently, we can determine the impact of temporary assistance on crime by comparing outcomes for those who call when funds are available to those who call when no funds are available. Linking this call center information to arrest records from the Chicago Police Department, we find some evidence that total arrests fall between 1 and 2 years after the call. For violent crime, police arrest those for whom funds were available 51% less often than those who were eligible but for whom no funds were available. Single individuals drive this decrease. The decline in crime appears to be related, in part, to greater housing stability—being referred to assistance significantly decreases arrests for homelessness-related, outdoor crimes such as trespassing. However, we also find that financial assistance leads to an increase in property crime arrests. This increase is evident for family heads, but not single individuals; the increase is mostly due to shoplifting; and the timing of this increase suggests that financial assistance enables some families to take on financial obligations that they are subsequently unable to meet. Overall, the change in the mix of crime induced by financial assistance generates considerable social benefits due to the greater social cost of violence.","outcomes":["Crime and justice"],"city":"Chicago","status":"Completed","countryX":"United States","countryY":"United States","stateX":"Illinois","stateY":"Illinois","quality":"High quality primary studies"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-87.6244","41.8756"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"E-268","type":"Effectiveness","studyDesign":"Before versus after design","studyType":"Impact evaluations","title":"Supporting Harm Reduction through Peer Support (SHARPS): testing the feasibility and acceptability of a peer-delivered, relational intervention for people with problem substance use who are homeless, to improve health outcomes, quality of life and social functioning and reduce harms: study protocol.

For some people with severe substance use problems, completely stopping their use is a complex challenge. Many people who end up being homeless have had very difficult lives including traumatic experiences. Harm reduction services can be useful in cutting the risks connected with substance use, for example needle exchange services. Harm reduction aims to support people ‘where they are at’, rather than trying to get people to change before they are ready or able to do so. Harm reduction supports people to improve their quality of life. While harm reduction is suggested for homeless people there is a lack of research on exactly how it should be delivered. This study will build on research that has already been done to show that trusting relationships with staff can help people with serious health and social problems. Homeless people need services that suit their specific needs, with staff that are good listeners, caring and understanding. Relationships seem to be most helpful when staff also offer practical help. This study will involve peer ‘Navigators’ providing practical and emotional support to homeless people who have substance use problems. Peers are people with personal experience of problem substance use who are recovering and have been trained in a range of areas. The word ‘Navigator’ is used to mean that these workers will closely support each person. The aim of this study is to explore whether the Peer Navigator programme can be delivered to people with serious problem substance use in hostel and outreach settings for homeless people.","outcomes":["Health","Housing stability"],"city":"Stirling","status":"Ongoing","countryX":"United Kingdom","countryY":"United Kingdom","stateX":"Scotland","stateY":"Scotland","quality":"Ongoing"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-3.936","56.1181"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"E-269","type":"Effectiveness","studyDesign":"Systematic reviews","studyType":"Systematic reviews","title":"Care Cascade for targeted tuberculosis testing and linkage to Care in Homeless Populations in the United States: a meta-analysis","year":"2018","url":"https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-018-5393-x","authors":"Parriott A ; Malekinejad M ; Miller A P; Marks S M; Horvath H ; Kahn D G;","interventionCategories":["Services and outreach","Health and social care"],"populationGroups":["People with/history of mental illness","People with existing health conditions (excluding HIV)"],"abstract":"BACKGROUND: Homelessness increases the risk of tuberculosis (TB) disease and latent TB infection (LTBI), but persons experiencing homelessness often lack access to testing and treatment. We assessed the yield of TB testing and linkage to care for programs targeting homeless populations in the United States. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive search of peer-reviewed and grey literature, adapting Cochrane systematic review methods. Two reviewers independently assessed study eligibility and abstracted key data on the testing to care cascade: number of persons reached, recruited for testing, tested for LTBI, with valid test results, referred to follow-up care, and initiating care. We used random effects to calculate pooled proportions and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of persons retained in each step via inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis, and cumulative proportions as products of adjacent step proportions. RESULTS: We identified 23 studies published between 1986 and 2014, conducted in 12 states and 15 cities. Among studies using tuberculin skin tests (TST) we found that 93.7% (CI 72.4-100%) of persons reached were recruited, 97.9% (89.3-100%) of those recruited had tests placed, 85.5% (78.6-91.3%) of those with tests placed returned for reading, 99.9% (99.6-100%) of those with tests read had valid results, and 24.7% (21.0-28.5%) with valid results tested positive. All persons testing positive were referred to follow-up care, and 99.8% attended at least one session of follow-up care. Heterogeneity was high for most pooled proportions. For a hypothetical cohort of 1000 persons experiencing homelessness reached by a targeted testing program using TST, an estimated 917 were tested, 194 were positive, and all of these initiated follow-up care. CONCLUSIONS: Targeted TB testing of persons experiencing homelessness appears effective in detecting LTBI and connecting persons to care and potential treatment. Future evaluations should assess diagnostic use of interferon gamma release assays and completion of treatment, and costs of testing and treatment.","outcomes":["Health"],"city":"Indianapolis","status":"Completed","countryX":"United States","countryY":"United States","stateX":"Indiana","stateY":"Indiana","quality":"High quality reviews"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-86.1584","39.7683"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"E-270","type":"Effectiveness","studyDesign":"Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs)","studyType":"Impact evaluations","title":"Housing First improves subjective quality of life among homeless adults with mental illness: 12-month findings from a randomized controlled trial in Vancouver, British Columbia","year":"2013","url":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00127-013-0719-6","authors":"Patterson M ; Moniruzzaman A ; Palepu A ; Zabkiewicz D ; Frankish C J; Krausz M ; Somers J M;","interventionCategories":["Accommodation and accommodation-based services"],"populationGroups":["People with/history of mental illness"],"abstract":"Purpose: This study used an experimental design to examine longitudinal changes in subjective quality of life (QoL) among homeless adults with mental illness after assignment to different types of supported housing or to treatment as usual (TAU, no housing or supports through the study). We hypothesized that subjective QoL would improve over time among participants assigned to supported housing as compared to TAU, regardless of the type of supported housing received or participants' level of need. Methods: Participants (n = 497) were stratified by level of need (\"high\" or \"moderate\") and randomly assigned to Housing First (HF) in scattered-site apartments, HF in a congregate setting (high needs only), or TAU. Linear mixed-effects regression was used to model the association between study arm and self-reported QoL at baseline and at 6 and 12 months post-baseline by need level. Results: Based on the adjusted overall score on the QoL measure, participants randomized to HF reported significantly greater overall QoL as compared to TAU, regardless of need level or type of supported housing at both 6 and 12 months post-baseline. Scores on the safety and living situation subscales were significantly greater for both high and moderate need participants assigned to supported housing regardless of type at both 6 and 12 months post-baseline as compared to TAU. Conclusions: Despite multiple health and social challenges faced by homeless individuals with mental illness, HF in both scattered-site and congregate models results in significantly greater perceived QoL as compared to individuals who do not receive HF even after a relatively short period of time.

The shelter-based Managed Alcohol Project (MAP) was created to deliver health care to homeless adults with alcoholism and to minimize harm; its effect upon consumption of alcohol and use of crisis services is described as proof of principle. METHODS: Subjects enrolled in MAP were dispensed alcohol on an hourly basis. Hospital charts were reviewed for all emergency department (ED) visits and admissions during the 3 years before and up to 2 years after program enrollment, and the police database was accessed for all encounters during the same periods. The results of blood tests were analyzed for trends. A questionnaire was administered to MAP participants and staff about alcohol use, health and activities of daily living before and during the program. Direct program costs were also recorded. RESULTS: Seventeen adults with an average age of 51 years and a mean duration of alcoholism of 35 years were enrolled in MAP for an average of 16 months. Their monthly mean group total of ED visits decreased from 13.5 to 8 (p = 0.004); police encounters, from 18.1 to 8.8 (p = 0.018). Changes in blood test findings were nonsignificant. All program participants reported less alcohol consumption during MAP, and subjects and staff alike reported improved hygiene, compliance with medical care and health. INTERPRETATION: A managed alcohol program for homeless people with chronic alcoholism can stabilize alcohol intake and significantly decrease ED visits and police encounters.","outcomes":["Cost","Crime and justice","Health"],"city":"Ottawa","status":"Completed","countryX":"Canada","countryY":"Canada","stateX":"","stateY":"","quality":"Medium quality primary studies"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-75.69","45.421"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"E-279","type":"Effectiveness","studyDesign":"Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs)","studyType":"Impact evaluations","title":"A randomised controlled trial of evidence based supported employment for people who have recently been homeless and have a mental illness","year":"2017","url":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10488-015-0713-2","authors":"Poremski D ; Rabouin D ; Latimer E ;","interventionCategories":["Employment"],"populationGroups":["People with/history of mental illness"],"abstract":"Individual placement and support (IPS) has not been tested experimentally among people recently housed with a scattered-site Housing First program.

In this study, we examined whether contingency management (CM) protocols that use tangible incentives for submission of drug-free specimens or other specific behaviors are effective for treatment-seeking substance abusers whose behavior may also be shaped by housing programs. Of 355 participants in randomized trials of CM, 56 (16%) reported using transitional housing during the 12-week treatment period. Main and interaction effects of housing status and treatment condition were evaluated for the primary substance abuse treatment outcomes: a) longest duration of abstinence from alcohol, cocaine, and opioids, b) percentage of samples submitted that were negative for these substances, and c) treatment retention. After controlling for demographic and clinical characteristics, those who accessed housing programs submitted a higher percentage of negative samples (75%) compared to those who did not access housing programs (67%). Housing status groups did not differ in terms of longest duration of abstinence (accessed housing: M = 3.1 weeks, SE = 0.6; did not access housing: M = 3.9 weeks, SE = 0.3) or retention in substance abuse treatment (accessed housing: M = 6.4 weeks, SE = 0.6; did not access housing: M = 6.6 weeks, SE = 0.3). Regardless of housing status, CM was associated with longer durations of abstinence and treatment retention. No interactive effects of housing and treatment condition were observed (p > .05). Results suggest that those who accessed housing programs during substance abuse treatment benefit from CM to a comparable degree as their peers who did not use such programs. These effects suggest that CM remains appropriate for those accessing housing in community-based programs.

Because voucher holders pay more toward their rent and utilities as their incomes rise, they face an implicit marginal “tax” on increased earnings (approximately 30 percent). Critics of this traditional rent policy also believe that it imposes a substantial and costly administrative burden on public housing agencies (PHAs), in part because it requires them to adjust subsidies up or down, as families’ incomes fall or rise, and to apply complicated rules in determining subsidy levels. Strong evidence is lacking on whether any alternative rent policies substantially improve tenants’ employment outcomes, or on what effects they might have on families’ receipt of housing subsidies or PHAs’ administrative burden and costs. In a step toward promoting innovative rent subsidy policies and building better evidence on “what works,” the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) launched the Rent Reform Demonstration. The demonstration, which began enrolling voucher holders in 2015, focuses on recipients of tenant-based housing choice vouchers in four cities and PHAs: Lexington-Fayette Urban County Housing Authority (generally referred to as the Lexington Housing Authority), in Lexington, KY; Louisville Metropolitan Housing Authority, in Louisville, KY; San Antonio Housing Authority, in San Antonio, TX; and District of Columbia Housing Authority, in Washington, D.C. These housing agencies are a subset of 39 PHAs that, at the time the project was launched, were part of HUD’s Moving to Work demonstration program, which allows selected PHAs more administrative flexibility in operating their housing assistance programs. HUD selected MDRC and its partners to lead the initiative,2 working closely with HUD and the four PHAs to design and evaluate an alternative rent policy using a randomized controlled trial. This report is the second in a series of five reports on the Rent Reform Demonstration. MDRC prepared the initial “Baseline” report in the series. Published by HUD in 2017, the Baseline report describes the origins of the Rent Reform Demonstration, the selection of PHAs, the features of the new policy, the rationale behind each of its main elements, the PHA’s initial implementation experiences, and the manner in which the policy is being evaluated (Riccio, Deitch, and Verma, 2017). This current \"Early Effects\" report presents early findings on the effects of the alternative rent policy on the employment and earnings of low-income adults who receive rental assistance through the federal Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program and on a variety of outcomes related to their housing subsidies. The report provides the first look at the new rent policy’s effects, or “impacts,” on families’ labor market and housing-related outcomes. It covers 2The study team includes the Urban Institute, the Bronner Group, Quadel Consulting & Training, and professors Ingrid Gould Ellen (New York University) and John Goering (City University of New York). ES-2 a followup period for each eligible family of approximately 12 to 18 months after the new policy took effect. Next in the series is the \"Interim Findings\" report. It presents results from the first 27-30 months of followup. The fourth report (expected in 2021) will provide findings from the long-term followup survey and the first triennial recertification, about 36 months after the new rent policy effective-date. The fifth and final report (expected in 2023) will present findings after the second triennial recertification, about 72 months after the new rent policy effective date. The 12- to 18-month followup timeframe of this report is too short for a full assessment of the new policy’s effects, in part because a critical feature of the policy—new rules governing families’ contributions to their rent and utilities—lasts 3 years. The report, nevertheless, does show whether or not the new policy began to effect change in the labor market and in housing-related outcomes relatively soon after implementation. The results indicate that when the findings for all four PHAs are combined, the new policy did not generate statistically significant increases in tenants’ average earnings over the first 18 months of followup. The story varied substantially across locations, however, with some early positive effects on earnings in Lexington and San Antonio but not in Louisville and Washington, D.C. Across all four agencies, the new policy reduced certain types of PHA transactions with families during the first 12 months of followup, generally somewhat reduced families’ expenditures for rent and utilities, and reduced their likelihood of exiting the voucher program. Because their rent and utilities costs were capped and they were somewhat less likely than control group families to exit the voucher program, those in the new rent rules group received more in housing subsidies during this period than they would have received under existing rules, as intended by the new policy’s goal of reducing work disincentives.","outcomes":["Employment and income"],"city":"Lexington","status":"Completed","countryX":"United States","countryY":"United States","stateX":"Kentucky","stateY":"Kentucky","quality":"High quality primary studies"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-84.497","38.0464"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"E-292","type":"Effectiveness","studyDesign":"Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs)","studyType":"Impact evaluations","title":"Problem-solving therapy to foster resilience among Veterans who are homeless or at-risk for homelessness: A pilot randomized controlled trial","year":"2017","url":"https://idea.library.drexel.edu/islandora/object/idea%3A6799","authors":"Ricelli S E;","interventionCategories":["Health and social care","Education and skills"],"populationGroups":["Veterans/Ex-services"],"abstract":"Homelessness among Veterans has declined in recent years, yet Veterans continue to be overrepresented in the United States homeless population, accounting for 11% of all homeless adults on a given night. Numerous stressors can contribute to unstable housing among Veterans and the lack of resources associated with homelessness may cause additional problems. The high burden of stress experienced by Veterans who are homeless or at-risk for homelessness appears to serve as a major obstacle to achieving housing stability. Therefore, an intervention that fosters resilience and adaptive coping may help them overcome such challenges and promote stable housing. Problem-solving therapy (PST) is an evidence-based, affective-cognitive-behavioral intervention that is viewed as potentially providing this population with effective skills to manage stressful problems engendered by housing instability through improving one's social problem solving (SPS). A program evaluation of a PST-based VA program called Moving Forward found it to be effective in improving resilience and overall distress among Veterans, including some who were homeless. Moreover, focus groups conducted by this investigator with homeless Veterans indicated interest in a program aimed at reducing stress, suggesting the feasibility of implementing a program with this population. The present study is a pilot randomized controlled trial to evaluate the feasibility and initial efficacy of a PST-based stress management program that aims to improve resilience, perceived stress, and SPS among Veterans with unstable housing. A sample of 51 Veterans who were homeless or at-risk for homelessness was recruited from an urban agency that provide services to homeless Veterans. Participants were randomly assigned to a treatment-as-usual wait-list control or active treatment, involving a 6-session PST-based protocol adapted specifically for group implementation with this population. A pre- and post-treatment assessment evaluated the primary outcomes of resilience, perceived stress, and social problem solving ability. Secondary outcomes include depressive symptoms, physical symptoms of stress, and engagement in behaviors directed toward the goal of achieving stable housing. Repeated measures analyses of variance were conducted for the outcome variables to determine interaction effects for per protocol and intent-to-treat analyses, but no significant treatment effects were found. A high study attrition rate of 76.5% resulted in only 12 study completers, and small sample size and confounding variables are believed to account for the lack of significant findings. Due to the high dropout rate, study completers and noncompleters were compared with independent samples t-tests, Chi square tests for independence, and Mann Whitney U tests to identify potential predictors of dropout. The endorsement of chronic pain and decreased ratings of engagement in behaviors directed toward the goal of achieving stable housing were identified as independent predictors of study dropout. Implications for the use of a PST-based program to improve outcomes among this population, as well as recommendations to improve the program and future research with this population, are discussed.

This article describes permanent supportive housing and reviews research. Methods Authors reviewed individual studies and literature reviews from 1995 through 2012. Databases surveyed were PubMed, PsycINFO, Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts, Sociological Abstracts, Social Services Abstracts, Published International Literature on Traumatic Stress, the Educational Resources Information Center, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature. The authors chose from three levels of evidence (high, moderate, and low) on the basis of benchmarks for the number of studies and quality of their methodology. They also described the evidence of service effectiveness. Results The level of evidence for permanent supportive housing was graded as moderate. Substantial literature, including seven randomized controlled trials, demonstrated that components of the model reduced homelessness, increased housing tenure, and decreased emergency room visits and hospitalization. Consumers consistently rated this model more positively than other housing models. Methodological flaws limited the ability to draw firm conclusions. Results were stronger for studies that compared permanent supportive housing with treatment as usual or no housing rather than with other models. Conclusions The moderate level of evidence indicates that permanent supportive housing is promising, but research is needed to clarify the model and determine the most effective elements for various subpopulations. Policy makers should consider including permanent supportive housing as a covered service for individuals with mental and substance use disorders. An evaluation component is needed to continue building its evidence base.","outcomes":["Capabilities and Wellbeing","Employment and income","Health","Housing stability"],"city":"Rockville","status":"Completed","countryX":"United States","countryY":"United States","stateX":"Maryland","stateY":"Maryland","quality":"Medium quality reviews"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-77.1528","39.084"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"E-295","type":"Effectiveness","studyDesign":"Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs)","studyType":"Impact evaluations","title":"Evaluation of the homebase community prevention program","year":"2013","url":"https://www.abtassociates.com/sites/default/files/migrated_files/cf819ade-6613-4664-9ac1-2344225c24d7.pdf","authors":"Rolston H ; Geyer J ; Locke G ; Metraux S ; Treglia D ;","interventionCategories":["Services and outreach"],"populationGroups":["Families with children"],"abstract":"Can a homelessness prevention program run by a network of neighborhood-based organizations keep at-risk families out of shelter and will the cost of the prevention services be offset by savings resulting from reducing shelter expenses?

In 1992, the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) established the HUD-VA Supported Housing (HUD-VASH) program. Methods Homeless veterans with psychiatric and/or substance abuse disorders or both (N = 460) were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups: (1) HUD-VASH, with Section 8 vouchers (rent subsidies) and intensive case management (n = 182);(2) case management only, without special access to Section 8 vouchers (n= 90); and (3) standard VA care (n = 188) Primary outcomes were days housed and days homeless. Secondary outcomes were mental health status, community adjustment, and costs from 4 perspectives. Results During a 3-year follow-up, HUD-VASH veterans had 16% more days housed than the case management– only group and 25% more days housed than the standard care group (P<.001 for both). The case management– only group had only 7% more days housed than the standard care group (P = .29). The HUD-VASH group also experienced 35% and 36% fewer days homeless than each of the control groups (P<.005 for both). There were no significant differences on any measures of psychiatric or substance abuse status or community adjustment, although HUD-VASH clients had larger social networks. From the societal perspective, HUD-VASH was $6200 (15%) more costly than standard care. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios suggest that HUD-VASH cost $45 more than standard care for each additional day housed (95% confidence interval, $−19 to $108). Conclusions Supported housing for homeless people with mental illness results in superior housing outcomes than intensive case management alone or standard care and modestly increases societal costs.","outcomes":["Capabilities and Wellbeing","Cost","Health","Housing stability"],"city":"Los Angeles","status":"Completed","countryX":"United States","countryY":"United States","stateX":"California","stateY":"California","quality":"High quality primary studies"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-118.2439","34.0544"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"E-298","type":"Effectiveness","studyDesign":"Before versus after design","studyType":"Impact evaluations","title":"Implementation of supported employment for homeless veterans with psychiatric or addiction disorders: Two-year outcomes","year":"2007","url":"https://ps.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/ps.2007.58.3.325?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed","authors":"Rosenheck R A; Mares A S;","interventionCategories":["Employment"],"populationGroups":["Veterans/Ex-services"],"abstract":"Objective: There has been growing interest in the dissemination of supported employment, but few studies have used a control group to examine the benefits of multisite dissemination efforts for clients or have addressed the needs of homeless persons with psychiatric disorders, addiction disorders, or both. This study examined a low-intensity training approach for implementing the individual placement and support (IPS) model at nine Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) programs and compared client outcomes before (phase 1) and after (phase 2) the program was implemented (phase 1). Methods: Special funds and sustained training, which was based primarily on teleconferencing, were used to support implementation of the IPS model of supported employment at nine VA programs for homeless veterans. A comparison cohort (phase 1) (N = 308) was recruited from the nine sites before IPS was implemented. A postimplementation cohort (phase 2) (N = 321) was recruited at the same sites and offered IPS. Mixed models were used to compare quarterly employment outcomes over two years in phase 1 and phase 2, adjusting for significant baseline differences (N = 629). Results: Measures of both client-level service delivery and site-level fidelity to IPS suggest that implementation was successful at most, but not all, sites. Overall, compared with veterans in the phase 1 group, those in the phase 2 group had a better long-term work history at the time of program entry. When the analyses controlled for baseline differences, the mean number of competitive employment days per month over the two-year follow-up period was 15% higher for veterans in phase 2 (8.4 days compared with 7.3 days; p < .001) and the mean number of days housed during follow-up was also higher in phase 2 (34.1 days compared with 29.8 days; p = .04), but there were no differences for other outcome measures. Conclusions: A sustained training program can be used to implement IPS in systems that have had little past experience with this approach. This effort was associated with improved employment outcomes and more rapid housing placement.

Furthermore, youth have the lowest rates of uptake and adherence to antiretroviral (ARV) medications and are least aware of their HIV status. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to design a set of interrelated studies to promote completion of each step of the HIV Prevention Continuum by uninfected youth at high risk (YHR), as well as completion of steps in the Treatment Continuum by youth living with HIV (YLH). METHODS: Gay, bisexual, and transgender youth; homeless youth; substance-abusing youth; youth with criminal justice contact; and youth with significant mental health challenges, particularly black and Latino individuals, are being recruited from 13 community-based organizations, clinics, drop-in centers, and shelters in Los Angeles and New Orleans. Youth are screened on the basis of self-reports and rapid diagnostic tests for HIV, drug use, and sexually transmitted infections and, then, triaged into one of 3 studies: (1) an observational cohort of YLH who have never received ARV medications and are then treated-half initially are in the acute infection period (n=36) and half with established HIV infection (n=36); (2) a randomized controlled trial (RCT) for YLH (N=220); and (3) an RCT for YHR (N=1340). Each study contrasts efficacy and costs of 3 interventions: an automated messaging and weekly monitoring program delivered via text messages (short message service, SMS); a peer support intervention delivered via social media forums; and coaching, delivered via text message (SMS), phone, and in-person or telehealth contacts. The primary outcomes are assessing youths' uptake and retention of and adherence to the HIV Prevention or Treatment Continua. Repeat assessments are conducted every 4 months over 24 months to engage and retain youth and to monitor their status. RESULTS: The project is funded from September 2016 through May 2021. Recruitment began in May 2017 and is expected to be completed by June 2019. We expect to submit the first results for publication by fall 2019. CONCLUSIONS: Using similar, flexible, and adaptable intervention approaches for YLH and YHR, this set of studies may provide a roadmap for communities to broadly address HIV risk among youth. We will evaluate whether the interventions are cost-efficient strategies that can be leveraged to help youth adhere to the actions in the HIV Prevention and Treatment Continua.

Objective To assess the effectiveness of a case management and housing program in reducing use of urgent medical services among homeless adults with chronic medical illnesses. Design, Setting, and Participants Randomized controlled trial conducted at a public teaching hospital and a private, nonprofit hospital in Chicago, Illinois. Participants were 407 social worker-referred homeless adults with chronic medical illnesses (89% of referrals) from September 2003 until May 2006, with follow-up through December 2007. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. Intervention Housing offered as transitional housing after hospitalization discharge, followed by placement in long-term housing; case management offered on-site at primary study sites, transitional housing, and stable housing sites. Usual care participants received standard discharge planning from hospital social workers. Main Outcome Measures Hospitalizations, hospital days, and emergency department visits measured using electronic surveillance, medical records, and interviews. Models were adjusted for baseline differences in demographics, insurance status, prior hospitalization or emergency department visit, human immunodeficiency virus infection, current use of alcohol or other drugs, mental health symptoms, and other factors. Results The analytic sample (n=405 [n=201 for the intervention group, n=204 for the usual care group]) was 78% men and 78% African American, with a median duration of homelessness of 30 months. After 18 months, 73% of participants had at least 1 hospitalization or emergency department visit. Compared with the usual care group, the intervention group had unadjusted annualized mean reductions of 0.5 hospitalizations (95% confidence interval [CI], -1.2 to 0.2), 2.7 fewer hospital days (95% CI, -5.6 to 0.2), and 1.2 fewer emergency department visits (95% CI, -2.4 to 0.03). Adjusting for baseline covariates, compared with the usual care group, the intervention group had a relative reduction of 29% in hospitalizations (95% CI, 10% to 44%), 29% in hospital days (95% CI, 8% to 45%), and 24% in emergency department visits (95% CI, 3% to 40%). Conclusion After adjustment, offering housing and case management to a population of homeless adults with chronic medical illnesses resulted in fewer hospital days and emergency department visits, compared with usual care.

Results:The mean age of participants was 41.8 years (SD = 8.6); they were mainly minorities (90%, n = 27 African- American) and mainly single/never married (70%, n = 21). Most (97%, n = 29) had past or current substance abuse and had been incarcerated (97%, n = 29).Ten individuals (33%) terminated the study prematurely. CAE-L was associated with good adherence to LAI (at 6 months, 76%) and dramatic improvement in oral medication adherence, which changed from missing 46% of medication at study enrollment to missing only 10% at study end (P = .03). There were significant improvements in psychiatric symptoms (P < .001) and functioning (P < .001). Akathisia was a major side effect with LAI. Conclusions: While interpretation of findings must be tempered by the methodological limitations, CAE-L appears to be associated with improved adherence, symptoms, and functioning in homeless or recently homeless individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Additional research is needed on effective and practical approaches to improving health outcomes for homeless people with serious mental illness.

Adapted from an empirically informed intervention to prevent recurrent homelessness among individuals, the Family Critical Time Intervention (FCTI) supports mothers with children for a 9-month period as they move from homeless shelters into affordable housing. The case management team uses a structured intervention to encourage mothers to create and maintain necessary connections in the community for key family supports. Method: We use a longitudinal randomized controlled trial (N = 210) to test whether homeless mothers referred to FCTI experience greater declines in psychopathology compared with those receiving homeless services-as-usual. All families receive access to affordable housing. Hierarchical linear models examine changes in symptomatology at shelter entry and 3, 9, and 15 months later. Results: Results suggest all homeless mothers report significant and clinically meaningful declines in mental distress over time, regardless of intervention condition. Treatment effects do not vary by prior homelessness experiences or receipt of mental health services. Conclusions: Homelessness presents acute stress for mothers that diminishes over time after families rehouse. In addition, improvements in maternal mental health fail to explain prior findings that associated FCTI with benefits in child and adolescent behavior. Taken together, FCTI with connection to affordable housing provides a useful approach with homeless families; however, additional research needs to articulate mechanisms involved in the intervention.","outcomes":["Health","Housing stability"],"city":"New York","status":"Completed","countryX":"United States","countryY":"United States","stateX":"New York","stateY":"New York","quality":"Low quality primary studies"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-73.9808","40.7648"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"E-307","type":"Effectiveness","studyDesign":"Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs)","studyType":"Impact evaluations","title":"Moving to opportunity for fair housing demonstration program: Final impacts evaluation","year":"2011","url":"https://www.huduser.gov/publications/pdf/MTOFHD_fullreport_v2.pdf","authors":"Sanbonmatsu L ; Katz L F; Ludwig J ; Gennetian L A; Duncan G J; Kessler R C; Adam E K; McDade T ; Lindau S T;","interventionCategories":["Prevention"],"populationGroups":["Families with children"],"abstract":"This report presents the long-term impacts of a unique housing mobility demonstration, Moving to Opportunity (MTO), on housing and neighborhood conditions, physical and mental health, economic self-sufficiency, risky and criminal behavior, and educational outcomes.

Providing primary care within addictions clinics (onsite care) may improve medical and SUD treatment outcomes in this population. Objective: The objective of this study was to compare outcomes among Veterans’ Administration (VA) patients who receive medical care within the SUD clinic and those referred to a general medicine clinic at the same facility. Methods: Veterans entering SUD treatment with a chronic medical condition and no current primary care were randomized to receive primary medical care: 1) onsite in the VA SUD clinic (n = 358), or 2) in the VA general internal medicine clinic (n = 362). Subjects were assessed at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months postrandomization. Intention-to-treat analyses used random-effects regression. Measures: Measures included SF-36 Physical and Mental Component Summaries (PCS, MCS), VA service utilization, SUD treatment retention, Addiction Severity Index (ASI) scores, 30-day abstinence, and total VA healthcare costs. Results: Over the study year, patients assigned to onsite care were more likely to attend primary care (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 2.20; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.53–3.15) and to remain engaged in SUD treatment at 3 months (adjusted OR = 1.36; 1.00–1.84). Overall, outcomes on the MCS (but not the PCS) and the ASI improved significantly over time but did not differ by treatment condition.

Public reconstruction housing has been built to improve their living conditions; however, those moving have to rebuild personal relationships and adapt to a new environment. This study examined whether survivors moving to public reconstruction housing became more socially isolated than those remaining in prefabricated temporary housing. Design, setting and participants Self-report questionnaire data collected in 2015 (4 years after the GEJE) were used as the baseline for follow-up surveys in 2016 and 2017, as many survivors moved from prefabricated temporary housing to public reconstruction housing from 2015. We analysed longitudinal data from 393 survivors, distinguishing those who moved to public reconstruction housing during the 5th year after the disaster from those who remained in prefabricated temporary housing. Participants were assessed using the Lubben Social Network Scale-6 (LSNS-6) in all three surveys, with social isolation defined by a score of <12/30. To reduce the effect of selection bias, propensity score analysis was performed (178 of 393 participants were retained). We used a generalised estimated equation to evaluate the association between moving from prefabricated temporary housing to public reconstruction housing and changes in social isolation over 2 years. Results LSNS-6 scores of the reconstruction housing group were worse than those of the prefabricated housing group between 4 and 6 years after the GEJE (P=0.006).

Methods: A quasi-experimental 18-month follow-up study was conducted with 157 persons newly entering supported housing and community residences. The housing models accepted persons with similar illness characteristics and homelessness histories, so that the inability to randomly assign tenants to housing types could be compensated for by propensity scoring methods. Tenure in housing was examined by using survival models. Analyses of other outcomes used hierarchical linear and regression models in both intent-to-treat (N=139) and true-stayer (N=80) analyses. Results: Tenure in housing did not differ by housing type. Substantial proportions of tenants in both models remained housed during the follow-up period. Tenants in supported housing reported greater housing satisfaction in terms of autonomy and economic viability. Over time some tenants in supported housing reported greater feelings of isolation. Independent of housing type, symptoms of depression or anxiety at housing entry increased the risk of poorer outcomes. Conclusions: The models of supported housing were viable portals of entry into community housing for homeless persons, even for consumers with characteristics indicating that they would have been more likely to be placed in community residences. The results suggest that greater clinical attention should be paid to persons who exhibit depression or anxiety when entering housing.

Methods: A systematic review was conducted. The eligibility criteria were original studies reporting economic evaluation results. The search was not restricted by language or year. A critical appraisal approach was used. Results: A total of 142 studies were identified, including five research articles (three full economic evaluations and two partial) that were selected for the final review. Most of the studies were conducted in the United States, adopted a public health perspective, and analyzed active TB. Interventions related to diagnostics/screening (the use of interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) and mobile screening units), treatment (incentives for continuing treatment, and housing programs), and prevention (with the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine) were identified. Conclusions: No high-quality data were found on cost-effectiveness of interventions on TB diagnostics/screening, treatment, or prevention in homeless people. However, active searching for cases via mobile screening, and financial incentives, could help increase treatment adherence, and the use of IGRA helps boost detection. TB in homeless people is neglected worldwide, especially in developing countries, where this disease tends to afflict more people made vulnerable by their precarious living conditions. Public funding mechanisms should be created to develop cross-sectoral actions targeting homeless people, as the complex dynamics of this group tend to hamper prevention and diagnosis of TB and the completion of TB treatment.","outcomes":["Capabilities and Wellbeing","Cost","Health"],"city":"London","status":"Completed","countryX":"United Kingdom","countryY":"United Kingdom","stateX":"England","stateY":"","quality":"High quality reviews"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-0.1276","51.5073"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"E-326","type":"Effectiveness","studyDesign":"Systematic reviews","studyType":"Systematic reviews","title":"A review of services and interventions for runaway and homeless youth: Moving forward","year":"2009","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190740909000371","authors":"Slesnick N ; Dashora P ; Letcher A ; Erdem G ; Serovich J ;","interventionCategories":["Services and outreach","Accommodation and accommodation-based services","Health and social care","Education and skills"],"populationGroups":["Young people"],"abstract":"Research focused on the impact of community-based services and treatment interventions designed to intervene in the lives of runaway and homeless youth has increased in the last two decades in the U.S. and internationally.

The first component was housing which included 3 months of rental and utility assistance, and these services were not contingent upon women's abstinence from drugs or alcohol. The second and third components included 6 months of case management services and an evidence-based substance abuse treatment (Community Reinforcement Approach; CRA). Analysis revealed that women showed reductions in substance use (F 2,22 = 3.63; p < .05), homelessness (F 2,24 = 25.31; p < .001), and mental health problems (F 2,20 = 8.5; p < .01).

However, there is a dearth of research focused on addressing substance use and related problems among these youth. In this study, youth were recruited from a drop-in center. Participants completed a pretreatment, 3 and 6-month follow-up assessment. Youth were randomly assigned to either service as usual (SAU) through the drop-in center (case management), or community reinforcement approach (CRA) therapy, a 12-session, behaviorally oriented individual therapy. As CRA targets many areas of change directly (substance use, social stability, related problems), it was expected that positive change on the outcome measures would be greater for youth at post-treatment in CRA compared to SAU. Preliminary analyses were conducted on the differential change between CRA and SAU groups. To date, 118 clients (62 CRA, 56 SAU) have completed pre and post-treatment assessments. Due to low power, only the pre and post-treatment assessments were used in the following analyses. An interaction between group and percent days of alcohol and drug use was found (F (1, 116) = 4.24, p <.05); youth assigned to CRA showed a greater reduction in substance use (38% decrease) compared to SAU (16% decrease). Social stability (percent days of work, education, medical care, living off of the streets) showed a trend toward an interaction (F (1, 116) = 3.61, p = .06), with CRA increasing significantly but not SAU. Other measures showed an overall time effect (both groups got better), including, condom attitudes, depression, problem consequences of drug/alcohol use, HIV knowledge, delinquency, internalizing and externalizing behaviors. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive treatment outcome pilot study with homeless substance abusing youth and findings show the positive impact or efficacy of the intervention (CRA) on this difficult to serve population. These preliminary findings provide support to continuing efforts to tailor and improve treatment services to homeless youth.","outcomes":["Capabilities and Wellbeing","Crime and justice","Employment and income","Health"],"city":"Columbus","status":"Completed","countryX":"United States","countryY":"United States","stateX":"Ohio","stateY":"Ohio","quality":"High quality primary studies"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-83.000556","39.962222"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"E-331","type":"Effectiveness","studyDesign":"Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs)","studyType":"Impact evaluations","title":"Treatment outcome for street-living, homeless youth","year":"2007","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306460306002759","authors":"Slesnick N ; Prestopnik J L; Meyers R J; Glassman M ;","interventionCategories":["Services and outreach"],"populationGroups":["Young people"],"abstract":"","outcomes":["Capabilities and Wellbeing","Crime and justice","Health"],"city":"Albuquerque","status":"Completed","countryX":"United States","countryY":"United States","stateX":"New Mexico","stateY":"New Mexico","quality":"High quality primary studies"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-106.651","35.0841"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"E-332","type":"Effectiveness","studyDesign":"Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs)","studyType":"Impact evaluations","title":"An evidence-based co-occurring disorder intervention in VA homeless programs: outcomes from a hybrid III trial","year":"2018","url":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12913-018-3123-9","authors":"Smelson D A; Chinman M ; Hannah G ; Byrne T ; McCarthy S ;","interventionCategories":["Services and outreach"],"populationGroups":["Veterans/Ex-services","People with complex needs/dual diagnosis"],"abstract":"Evidence-based treatment for co-occurring disorders is needed within programs that serve homeless Veterans to assist with increasing engagement in care and to prevent future housing loss.

However, this population often has difficulty engaging in treatment for co-occurring disorders, which can result in exacerbation of symptoms and housing loss. Maintaining Independence and Sobriety Through Systems Integration, Outreach, and Networking (MISSION) is a co-occurring mental health and substance use wraparound approach that was pilot-tested alongside Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH) to improve treatment access and engagement. This pilot was part of a state plan to end homelessness in the Boston metro area. METHODS:This open pilot study enrolled 136 individuals who were chronically homeless and offered one year of MISSION along with PSH. Program participants also received baseline and 6- and 12-month follow-up assessments. RESULTS:At one-year follow-up, 82.4% of the program participants were housed in PSH. However, due to limited affordable housing in the Boston metro area, it took on average 6.20 months to house the program participants. Furthermore, while MISSION was feasible to implement alongside PSH, fidelity to the MISSION model was lower than expected. This pilot also examined the role of housing status on clinical outcomes and found that the program participants who were housed at the time of discharge displayed a statistically significant improvement in emergency room visits for mental health complaints, the Psychosis subscale of the Behavior and Symptom Identification Scale (BASIS-32), illegal drug use, and pharmacotherapy treatment. CONCLUSIONS:This pilot study demonstrated that systematically integrating PSH and MISSION can improve access and engagement in care, housing retention, and mental health outcomes. Despite the preliminary success and while taking into account the limitations of the open single-group pre/post design, this study also identified the lack of affordable housing as a potential barrier to placement as well as the critical role of housing for improved clinical outcomes. Randomized controlled trials are needed to test MISSION with PSH as well as perhaps PSH with and without MISSION to tease apart the effects of integrating both approaches simultaneously.","outcomes":["Health","Housing stability"],"city":"Boston","status":"Completed","countryX":"United States","countryY":"United States","stateX":"Massachusets","stateY":"Massachusets","quality":"Medium quality primary studies"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-71.063611","42.358056"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"E-334","type":"Effectiveness","studyDesign":"Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs)","studyType":"Impact evaluations","title":"The community reinforcement approach with homeless alcohol-dependent individuals","year":"1998","url":"http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1998-02631-011","authors":"Smith J E; Meyers R J; Delaney H D;","interventionCategories":["Services and outreach","Education and skills"],"populationGroups":["People with alcohol/drug issues"],"abstract":"","outcomes":["Employment and income","Health","Housing stability"],"city":"Albuquerque","status":"Completed","countryX":"United States","countryY":"United States","stateX":"New Mexico","stateY":"New Mexico","quality":"High quality primary studies"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-106.651","35.0841"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"E-335","type":"Effectiveness","studyDesign":"Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs)","studyType":"Impact evaluations","title":"Changes in daily substance use among people experiencing homelessness and mental illness: 24-month outcomes following randomization to Housing First or usual care","year":"2015","url":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/add.13011","authors":"Somers J M; Moniruzzaman A ; Palepu A ;","interventionCategories":["Services and outreach","Accommodation and accommodation-based services"],"populationGroups":["People with/history of mental illness"],"abstract":"Aims Housing First (HF) is an established intervention for people experiencing homelessness and mental illness.

Setting Market rental apartments with support provided by Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) or Intensive Case Management (ICM); a single building with on-site supports (CONG); TAU in Vancouver, Canada. Participants Inclusion criteria were current homelessness and mental illness. Participants were assessed as having either 'high needs' (HN; n=297) or 'moderate needs' (MN; n=200). MN participants were randomized to ICM (n=100) or MN-TAU (n=100). HN participants were randomized to ACT (n=90), CONG (n=107) or HN-TAU (n=100). Interventions and comparators All HF interventions included independent housing with support services, with an emphasis on promoting client choice and harm reduction in relation to substance use. TAU included existing services and support available to homeless adults with mental illness. Measurements DSU over 24 and 12 months was derived from the Maudsley Addiction Profile. Also measured were demographics, homelessness history, psychiatric diagnoses, symptom severity, comorbid illnesses and duration of stable housing. Findings Compared with HN-TAU, neither CONG [adjusted odds (AOR) ratio=0.73, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.39-1.37] nor ACT (AOR=1.22, 95% CI=0.61-2.45) differed on DSU at 24 months, and MN-TAU did not differ from ICM (AOR=0.78, 95% CI=0.37-1.63). There were no differences at 12 months, when analyses were restricted to participants who indicated substance use at baseline, or when considering the duration of stable housing.

DESIGN: Prospective, single-blind, randomized trial comparing self-guided completion of an advance directive with professionally assisted advance care planning. (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT00546884) SETTING: 8 sites serving homeless persons in Minneapolis, Minnesota. PARTICIPANTS: 262 homeless persons recruited between November 2007 and August 2008. INTERVENTION: Minimal, self-guided intervention consisting of advance directive forms and written educational information versus a one-on-one advance planning intervention consisting of counseling and completing an advance directive with a social worker. MEASUREMENTS: Rate of advance directive completion, assessed by inspection of completed documents. RESULTS: The overall completion rate for advance directives was 26.7% (95% CI, 21.5% to 32.5%), with a higher rate in the counselor-guided group (37.9%) than in the self-guided group (12.8%) (CI of adjusted difference, 15.3 to 34.3 percentage points). This difference persisted across all sites and most subgroups. The advance directive's 4 clinical scenarios found a preference for surrogate decision making in 29% to 34% of written responses. LIMITATIONS: Sampling was limited to a more stable subset of the homeless population in Minneapolis and may have been subject to selection bias. Modest compensation to complete the preintervention survey could have influenced participants to complete advance directives. CONCLUSION: Both a simple and complex intervention successfully engaged a diverse sample of homeless persons in advance care planning. One-on-one assistance significantly increased the completion rate. Homeless persons can respond to an intervention to plan for end-of-life care and can express specific preferences for care or a surrogate decision maker, but additional studies are needed to assess the effect of these directives on subsequent care.

Interim housing programs represent a new approach to housing and serving homeless adults, one which provides emergency housing in apartment-like units, and in which use of services is voluntary. Shelters tend to provide congregate care and to expect or rely on clients to access needed services in order to secure resources required to obtain housing. Analyses of original survey data, which correct for sample selection utilizing propensity scores, suggest that clients in interim housing programs obtain more professional, advocacy, and employment services than do clients in shelters. This differential service use is found to reflect not client incentives, but the service offerings and referrals made by the programs. In general, the findings suggest that interim housing programs hold particular promise in service rich environments. They also suggest that program contingencies are more important than certain individual client incentives in affecting service use. Finally, the results begin to suggest the value of this new, interim housing-based approach.","outcomes":["Employment and income"],"city":"Chicago","status":"Completed","countryX":"United States","countryY":"United States","stateX":"Illinois","stateY":"Illinois","quality":"Medium quality primary studies"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-87.6244","41.8756"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"E-342","type":"Effectiveness","studyDesign":"Systematic reviews","studyType":"Systematic reviews","title":"A systematic review of interventions for homeless women","year":"2013","url":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jocn.12056","authors":"Speirs V ; Johnson M ; Jirojwong S ;","interventionCategories":["Services and outreach","Health and social care"],"populationGroups":["Women and girls"],"abstract":"Aims and objectives: The aim of this research is to undertake a systematic review of the existing literature to determine effective physical and psychosocial interventions for homeless women. Background: Homelessness is an increasing problem worldwide. Homelessness results in considerable risk to the health and social and psychological well-being of those without permanent shelter. Community nurses require effective interventions to assist homeless women to improve their health; however, little is known about effective interventions for this unique group. Methods: A search of several databases was conducted. Seven hundred and fifteen papers were initially identified, with only six studies meeting the inclusion criteria. Results: The methodologies included the following: randomised controlled trials (2), quasi-experimental (3) and a comparative study (1). Due to the diversity of the designs, measurement tools, interventions and outcomes of these studies, narrative synthesis was used to appraise their effectiveness. Study interventions such as structured education and support sessions (with and without advocates or support persons) and therapeutic communities reduced psychological distress and healthcare use, improved self-esteem, reduced drug and alcohol use within some limitations. Conclusions: The aspects of the effective interventions could form the basis of community nursing programmes for our communities. Further research is required to ensure that homeless women and their children receive effective nursing interventions. Revelance to clinical practice: Community nursing can develop and trial programmes for homeless women including content within group sessions, counselling or advocacy within or without a therapeutic community, as presented in this review.

In Los Angeles County a large proportion of those funds is used to fund Full Service Partnerships, intensive outpatient programs that are based on the Assertive Community Treatment model and provide services to adults with severe mental illness and extensive past-year histories of homelessness, incarceration, or inpatient or emergency psychiatric treatment, or who would be at risk of these outcomes if not for their family's support. These programs provide intensive care to a relatively small number of clients, while existing programs continue to suffer from budget shortfalls. This dissertation follows clients from six Los Angeles County Department of Mental Health clinics to evaluate the effect of FSP enrollment on public mental health services costs and health utility (preference-weighted health-related quality of life outcomes), using a matched comparison sample of clients receiving Usual Care services from these clinics and data from the year prior to admission and the first year following admission. Adjusted difference-in-difference analyses find that, in terms of public mental health services costs, FSP programs are considerably more expensive than Usual Care for comparable clients with severe mental illness. FSP clients receive much more intensive outpatient services than Usual Care clients, and, relative to Usual Care clients, the greater increase in outpatient costs relative to the pre-enrollment year is not offset by reductions in intensive utilization like emergency or inpatient services. These analyses do not include data on jail mental health or pharmacy costs; however, while we hypothesize that jail mental health costs will decline for FSP clients relative to Usual Care, these decreases are not expected to be large enough to offset the increased outpatient costs of FSP treatment relative to Usual Care. Analysis of health utility outcomes finds that FSP clients may have slightly higher health utility one year after admission than clients enrolled in Usual Care. However, unless higher benefits or lower costs are observed when a longer follow-up timeline is used, this difference in health utility is too small to justify the higher cost of FSP programs from the perspective of the public mental health system.

By providing permanent, independent housing without prerequisites for sobriety and treatment, and by offering support services through consumer-driven Assertive Community Treatment teams, Housing First removes some of the major obstacles to obtaining and maintaining housing for consumers who are chronically homeless. In this study, consumers diagnosed with severe mental illness and who had the longest histories of shelter use in a suburban county were randomly assigned to either one of two Housing First programs or to a treatment-as-usual control group. Participants assigned to Housing First were placed in permanent housing at higher rates than the treatment-as-usual group and, over the course of four years, the majority of consumers placed by both Housing First agencies were able to maintain permanent, independent housing. Results also highlight that providers new to Housing First must be aware of ways in which their practices may deviate from the essential features of Housing First, particularly with respect to enrolling eligible consumers on a first-come, first-served basis and separating clinical issues from tenant or housing responsibilities.

This study evaluates the effectiveness of HF with Intensive Case Management (ICM) among ethnically diverse homeless adults in an urban setting. 378 participants were randomized to HF with ICM or treatment-as-usual (TAU) in Toronto (Canada), and followed for 24 months. Measures of effectiveness included housing stability, physical (EQ5D-VAS) and mental (CSI, GAIN-SS) health, social functioning (MCAS), quality of life (QoLI20), and health service use. Two-thirds of the sample (63%) was from racialized groups and half (50%) were born outside Canada. Over the 24 months of follow-up, HF participants spent a significantly greater percentage of time in stable residences compared to TAU participants (75.1% 95% CI 70.5 to 79.7 vs. 39.3% 95% CI 34.3 to 44.2, respectively). Similarly, community functioning (MCAS) improved significantly from baseline in HF compared to TAU participants (change in mean difference = +1.67 95% CI 0.04 to 3.30). There was a significant reduction in the number of days spent experiencing alcohol problems among the HF compared to TAU participants at 24 months (ratio of rate ratios = 0.47 95% CI 0.22 to 0.99) relative to baseline, a reduction of 53%. Although the number of emergency department visits and days in hospital over 24 months did not differ significantly between HF and TAU participants, fewer HF participants compared to TAU participants had 1 or more hospitalizations during this period (70.4% vs. 81.1%, respectively; P=0.044). Compared to non-racialized HF participants, racialized HF participants saw an increase in the amount of money spent on alcohol (change in mean difference = $112.90 95% CI 5.84 to 219.96) and a reduction in physical community integration (ratio of rate ratios = 0.67 95% CI 0.47 to 0.96) from baseline to 24 months.

METHOD: Using a pre-post cohort design, 223 homeless adults with mental health needs were enrolled in the Coordinated Access to Care for the Homeless (CATCH) program, a 4- to 6-month interdisciplinary intervention offering case management, peer support, access to primary psychiatric care, and supplementary community services. Study participants were interviewed at program entry and at 3- and 6-month follow-up visits and assessed for health status, acute care service use, housing outcomes, mental health, substance use, quality of life, and their working alliance with service providers. Linear mixed models and generalized estimating equations were performed to examine outcomes longitudinally. Additional post hoc analyses evaluated differences between CATCH participants and a comparison group of homeless adults experiencing mental illness who received usual services over the same period. RESULTS: In the pre-post analyses, CATCH participants had statistically significant improvements in mental and physical health status and reductions in mental health symptoms, substance misuse, and the number of hospital admissions. The strength of the working alliance between participants and their case manager was associated with reduced health care use and mental health symptoms. Post hoc analyses suggest that CATCH may be associated with statistically significant improvements in mental health symptoms in the study population.

Objective To examine the effect of scattered-site housing with ICM services on housing stability and generic quality of life among homeless adults with mental illness and moderate support needs for mental health services. Design, Setting, and Participants The At Home/Chez Soi project was an unblinded, randomized trial. From October 2009 to July 2011, participants (N = 1198) were recruited in 4 Canadian cities (Vancouver, Winnipeg, Toronto, and Montreal), randomized to the intervention group (n = 689) or usual care group (n = 509), and followed up for 24 months. Interventions The intervention consisted of scattered-site housing (using rent supplements) and off-site ICM services. The usual care group had access to existing housing and support services in their communities. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was the percentage of days stably housed during the 24-month period following randomization. The secondary outcome was generic quality of life, assessed by a EuroQoL 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) health questionnaire. Results During the 24 months after randomization, the adjusted percentage of days stably housed was higher among the intervention group than the usual care group, although adjusted mean differences varied across study cities (Site A: 417.3 of 683.0 days [62.7%] for the intervention group vs 189.2 of 621.6 days [29.7%] for the usual care group, mean difference [MD], 33.0% [95% CI, 26.2% to 39.8%]; Site B: 491.5 of 653.4 days [73.2%] for the intervention group vs 157.0 of 606.8 [23.6%] for the usual care group, MD, 49.5% [95% CI, 41.1% to 58.0%]; Site C: 506.7 of 658.1 days [74.4%] for the intervention group vs 255.2 of 626.2 days (38.8%) for the usual care group, MD, 35.6% [95% CI, 29.4% to 41.8%]; Site D: 520.4 of 651.5 days [77.2%] for the intervention group vs 223.1 of 649.1 for the usual care group [31.8%], MD, 45.3% [95% CI, 38.2% to 52.2%]; P<.001 for interaction). The mean change of the EQ-5D score from baseline to 24 months among the intervention group was not statistically different from the usual care group (60.5 [95% CI, 58.6 to 62.5] at baseline and 67.2 [95% CI, 65.2 to 69.1] at 24 months for the intervention group vs 62.1 [95% CI, 59.9 to 64.4] at baseline and 68.6 [95% CI, 66.3 to 71.0] at 24 months for the usual care group, difference in mean changes, 0.10 [95% CI, −2.92 to 3.13], P=.95).

In phase 1, participants were stratified by level of need for mental health support services (high vs moderate), and randomly assigned (1:1) using adaptive randomisation procedures to Housing First with assertive community treatment (HF-ACT), Housing First with intensive case management (HF-ICM), or to treatment as usual (TAU). Participants with moderate support needs were further stratified by ethnoracial status. Considering the nature of the Housing First intervention, study participants and study personnel were not masked to group assignment. Phase 1 participants could choose to enrol in the extension study (phase 2). The primary outcome was the rate of days stably housed per year analysed in the modified intention-to-treat population, which included all randomly assigned participants who had at least one assessment for the primary outcome. Participants contributed data to the study up to the point of their last interview. Multilevel multiple imputation was used to handle missing data. The trial was registered with ISRCTN, ISRCTN42520374. FINDINGS: Between Oct 1, 2009, and March 31, 2013, 575 individuals participated in phase 1 of the Toronto Site At Home/Chez Soi study (197 [34%] participants with high support needs and 378 [66%] with moderate support needs). Of the 378 participants with moderate support needs, 204 were randomly assigned to receive the HF intervention with ICM or with ethnoracial-specific ICM services (HF-ER-ICM; HF-ICM or HF-ER-ICM groups) and 174 were randomly assigned to TAU. Of the 197 participants with high support needs, 97 were randomly assigned to receive the HF intervention with ACT (HF-ACT treatment group) and 100 were randomly assigned to TAU group. Between Jan 1, 2014, and March 31, 2017, 414 (81%) of 575 phase 1 participants participated in the extended phase 2 study. The median duration of follow-up was 5.4 years (IQR 2.1-5.9). Among phase 2 participants, 141 had high support needs (79 participants in the HF-ACT group; 62 participants in the TAU group), and 273 had moderate support needs (160 participants in the HF-ICM or HF-ER-ICM group; 113 participants in the TAU group). 187 high support needs participants (93 participants in the HF-ACT group, 94 participants in the TAU group), and 361 moderate support needs participants (201 participants in the HF-ICM or HF-ER-ICM group, 160 participants in the TAU group) were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis for the primary outcome. The number of days spent stably housed was significantly higher among participants in the HF-ACT and HR-ICM or HF-ER-ICM groups than participants in the TAU groups at all timepoints. For participants with moderate support needs, the rate ratio (RR) of days stably housed in the Housing First group, compared with TAU, was 2.40 (95% CI 2.03-2.83) in year 1, which decreased to 1.13 (1.01-1.26) in year 6. The RR of days stably housed for participants with high support needs, compared with TAU, was 3.02 (2.43-3.75) in year 1 and 1.42 (1.19-1.69) in year 6. In year 6, high support needs participants in the Housing First group spent 85.51% of days stably housed compared with 60.33% for the TAU group, and moderate needs participants in the Housing First group spent 88.16% of days stably housed compared with 78.22% for the TAU group. INTERPRETATION: Rent supplements and mental health support services had an enduring positive effect on housing stability for homeless adults with mental illness in a large, resource-rich urban centre, with a larger impact on individuals with high support needs than moderate support needs.

Sustained and regular participation in physical activity is beneficial for both mental and physical health. Limited data suggest that levels of physical activity in the homeless and those at risk of homelessness are low, and access to community‐based exercise is limited or non‐existent for this population. Nonetheless, exercise programmes for the homeless could provide a feasible and scalable intervention for providing beneficial effects on physical and mental health in this population. The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of a group exercise intervention on activity levels in people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness in central London, UK. The secondary aim is to evaluate the impact of the intervention on mental and physical health outcomes.

In response, domestic violence shelter programs have focused increasing attention on helping adult and child survivors understand and heal from this trauma. What have come to be called trauma-informed practices include (a) reflecting an understanding of trauma and its many effects on health and behavior, (b) addressing both physical and psychological safety concerns, (c) using a culturally informed strengths-based approach, (d) helping to illuminate the nature and effects of abuse on survivors' everyday experience; and (e) providing opportunities for clients to regain control over their lives. Despite the proliferation of these practices, little is known about their effects on survivors. In response, the current study explored the extent to which trauma-informed practices, as experienced by shelter residents, related to changes in their levels of self-efficacy, safety-related empowerment, and depressive symptoms over the course of approximately 30 days in shelter. Fifty-seven shelter residents from 4 programs in Ohio completed surveys shortly after arriving in shelter and again before exit. Their perception of the degree to which they received trauma-informed services was associated with significant improvement in their self-efficacy and safety-related empowerment, but had no impact on depressive symptoms. Depressive symptoms decreased over time, regardless of receipt of trauma-informed practice. Implications for policy and practice are discussed.

Despite its promise as an alternative to traditional sequential residential rehabilitation programs, supported housing has not been evaluated to an extent that supports firm conclusions concerning the efficacy of specific program elements. We conducted a comprehensive review of the literature on supported housing and similarly labeled programs, to determine the degree of clarity in the supported housing model and the degree of fidelity to that model within the empirical literature, and to determine whether lack of clarity or fidelity are barriers to widespread, systematic program implementation and evaluation. We encountered a number of limitations in the literature, including conflicting use of program labels, inconsistent definitions of supported housing and its elements, and use of inadequate measurement indices in assessing adherence to program elements. Our findings suggest that greater model clarity, better specification of model elements, and greater standardization in measurement of program dimensions would aid in supported housing program implementation and evaluation.

A growing number of households are spending more than 50% of their income for housing, the U.S poverty rate is growing and family homelessness increased by 1.4% from 2011 to 2012. There is an urgent need for policy research evidence on Rapid Re-Housing (RRH), time-limited housing assistance, one of the Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) top strategies for ending homelessness. Assessing the impacts of the RRH program funded by the Homeless Prevention and Rapid Re-Housing Program (HPRP) from 2009-2012 in the City of Philadelphia , this dissertation addressed two research questions: 1) Does Rapid Re-Housing improve housing stability for formerly homeless households by decreasing the risk of a return to homelessness? 2) Did HPRP's RRH policy experience propel a nationwide shift in the homeless assistance response system, away from shelter-centric towards housing-centric service approaches? This research analyzed data from all households entering homeless shelters between October 2009 and May 2012 in Philadelphia. Data analysis included a propensity score match to create a comparable comparison group to the treatment group of all households that entered the City's RRH program; 2,455 households were included in the study. Return to homelessness outcomes were assessed for both treatment and control groups one and two years after exiting RRH, or exiting shelter. RRH resulted in a 42% decrease in the risk of a return to homelessness. An instrumental variable analysis was also performed to verify these findings, and the two-stage least regression results indicated a 25% decrease in the risk of a return to homelessness for RRH households. The effect size decreased with the sensitivity of each analysis, illustrating unobserved characteristics of people enrolled in RRH made them less likely to return to homelessness. Overall, these analyses show the odds of returning to homelessness are higher for households that do not receive RRH compared to similar households that do receive RRH. Results from the policy analysis indicate that HPRP did precipitate RRH policy learning across the country, expanding the Housing First experience of RRH.

This study assessed whether the ACT model of care was related to clinical and social outcomes among patients who had experienced a first episode of psychosis. Methods: The sample was drawn from the Lambeth Early Onset Trial, a study of 144 patients in the United Kingdom who sought treatment for a first episode of psychosis between January 2000 and October 2001 and who were randomly assigned to a specialized early intervention modeled on ACT or standard care. The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, the Global Assessment of Functioning, and the Significant Others Scale were administered at six-month and 18-month follow-ups. Results: Data on social support were available at both follow-ups for 57 patients assigned to specialized care and 50 patients assigned to standard care. The two groups were similar in personal characteristics, relationship status, and living arrangements at baseline and at six-month follow-up, but by 18 months, patients in specialized care reported having a higher mean±SD number of significant others in their social networks than did standard care patients (2.40±1.20 and 1.71±1.06, respectively; p=.01). They also achieved superior clinical outcomes at 18 months, and these outcomes were associated with network size. Conclusion: Early intervention by using an ACT model of care may improve clinical results by reestablishing or maintaining bonds between patients and family, friends, and acquaintances.","outcomes":["Capabilities and Wellbeing","Health"],"city":"Lambeth","status":"Completed","countryX":"United Kingdom","countryY":"United Kingdom","stateX":"England","stateY":"England","quality":"Medium quality primary studies"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-0.121445","51.460218"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"E-361","type":"Effectiveness","studyDesign":"Systematic reviews","studyType":"Systematic reviews","title":"A systematic review of occupational therapy interventions with homeless people","year":"2011","url":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/07380577.2010.528554","authors":"Thomas Y ; Gray M ; McGinty S ;","interventionCategories":["Education and skills"],"populationGroups":["Other"],"abstract":"A systematic review of the occupational therapy literature 1990-2008 was undertaken with the aim to assess the quality of evidence that supports the role of occupational therapy with homeless people.

We therefore developed a brief intervention (BI) to reduce both alcohol use and sexual risk behaviors among homeless young adults. The results of a randomized trial testing the BI against an education comparison (EC) are presented. Method: Young adults (N = 61; age 17-22 years) from an urban, Northeastern crisis shelter were randomly assigned to either the two-session, individual-level BI or a time-matched, two-session, individual-level EC. Generalized linear mixed models for repeated measures determined effects of treatment condition on outcomes. Results: The BI significantly increased participant readiness to change alcohol use. However, it did not significantly decrease primary alcohol or HIV sexual risk outcomes, independently or relative to EC (all ps > 0.05). Participants in the EC reduced times engaged in unprotected sex between baseline and post-intervention to a significantly greater extent (p < 0.01) than those in the BI condition. Participants in both conditions reported satisfaction with respective interventions. Conclusions: Findings suggest that the BI was acceptable and successful in getting participants to consider changing their drinking. However, lack of change in alcohol and sexual behavior outcomes indicates the need for further research to determine how to translate readiness to change into actual behavioral change among homeless young adults.

From the limited research that has been done, emerging evidence signals that, although structural supports such as subsidized housing and social service providers are important, these resources alone are insufficient to help young people integrate into the mainstream society. Objective: The overarching aim of this study is to assess whether and how rent subsidies and mentorship influence social integration outcomes for formerly homeless young people living in market rent housing in 3 Canadian cities. The primary outcome measures for this study are community integration (psychological and physical) and self-esteem at 18 months. Secondary outcomes include social connectedness, hope, and academic and vocational participation at 18 months. Exploratory outcomes include income, perceived housing quality, engulfment, psychiatric symptoms, and participant perspectives of intervention barriers and facilitators. Methods: This is a convergent mixed methods, open-label, 2-arm parallel randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 1:1 allocation embedded within a community-based participatory action research (CBPAR) framework. The intervention will provide 24 young people (aged 16-26 years), who have transitioned out of homelessness and into market rent housing within the past year, with rent subsidies for 24 months. Half of the young people will also be randomly assigned an adult mentor who has been recruited and screened by 1 of our 3 community partners. Data collection will occur every 6 months, and participants will be followed for 30 months. Results: Ethical approval for this study has been obtained from the Providence, St Joseph’s, and St Michael’s Healthcare Research Ethics Board (number 18-251). Enrollment took place from April 2019 to September 2019. Preliminary analysis of the baseline quantitative and qualitative data is underway. Conclusions: This pilot RCT will be the first to test the impact of economic and social support on meaningful social integration for formerly homeless young people living in market rent housing. We believe that the mixed methods design will illuminate important contextual factors that must be considered if the intervention is to be scaled up and replicated elsewhere. Importantly, the CBPAR framework will incorporate the perspectives of the community, including formerly homeless young people, who are in the best position to determine what might work best in the context of their lives.","outcomes":["Capabilities and Wellbeing","Employment and income","Health","Housing stability"],"city":"Toronto","status":"Ongoing","countryX":"Canada","countryY":"Canada","stateX":"","stateY":"","quality":"Medium/high quality primary studies"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-79.3849","43.6529"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"E-364","type":"Effectiveness","studyDesign":"Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs)","studyType":"Impact evaluations","title":"Effectiveness of a Housing Support Team Intervention with a Recovery-Oriented Approach on Hospital and Emergency Department Use by Homeless People with Severe Mental Illness: A Randomized Controlled Trial","year":"2019","url":"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3417890","authors":"Tinland A ; Loubiere S ; Boucekine M ; Boyer L ; Fond G ; Girard V ; Auquier P ;","interventionCategories":["Accommodation and accommodation-based services"],"populationGroups":["People with/history of mental illness","People with complex needs/dual diagnosis","People with alcohol/drug issues"],"abstract":"Frequent emergency department (ED) users experiencing homelessness are associated with high costs for healthcare systems yet interventions for this group have been minimally investigated.

Following discharge from inpatient psychiatric treatment in New York City, 150 previously homeless persons living with serious mental illness were randomly assigned to receive usual services only or 9 months of CTI in addition to usual services. Results: Findings from mixed-effects regression models indicated that those assigned to the CTI group reported greater frequency of family contact and greater improvement in satisfaction with family relations than the comparison group during the 18-month follow-up period. Mediation analysis revealed that greater improvement in satisfaction with family relations mediated the effect of CTI on psychiatric rehospitalization outcome, but only at a modest level. Conclusion and Implications for Practice: These findings suggest that a relatively brief but targeted intervention delivered at the point of hospital discharge may contribute to strengthening family relations and that improvement in perceived family relationship quality can contribute to a reduction in psychiatric rehospitalization.","outcomes":["Capabilities and Wellbeing","Health"],"city":"New York","status":"Completed","countryX":"United States","countryY":"United States","stateX":"New York","stateY":"New York","quality":"Medium quality primary studies"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-73.9808","40.7648"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"E-368","type":"Effectiveness","studyDesign":"Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs)","studyType":"Impact evaluations","title":"Examining the impact and theoretical pathway of critical time intervention on psychiatric re-hospitalization outcomes among formerly homeless individuals with severe mental illness","year":"2011","url":"https://books.google.co.in/books/about/Examining_the_Impact_and_Theoretical_Pat.html?id=Zds8MwEACAAJ&redir_esc=y","authors":"Tomita A M;","interventionCategories":["Services and outreach"],"populationGroups":["People with/history of mental illness"],"abstract":"This three-paper dissertation examines data collected from a randomized controlled trial study of Critical Time Intervention (CTI) for 150 formerly homeless individuals with severe mental illness. CTI is a nine-month, time-limited intervention designed to support formerly homeless individuals suffering from severe mental illness in their transition from institutions to community living. The first paper examines the role of CTI and family social support on psychiatric re-hospitalization. The results from the first paper indicate that assignment to CTI significantly improved the perception of family social support in the nine-month period. Furthermore, assignment to CTI and a high perception of family social support were significantly associated with a reduction in psychiatric re-hospitalization over the 18-month period. The second paper examines the role of CTI and self-reported medication adherence on psychiatric re-hospitalization. The results from the second study indicate that assignment to CTI and improvement in medication adherence were significantly associated with a reduction in psychiatric re-hospitalization over the 18-month period. There was no statistically significant association between assignment to CTI and improvement in medication adherence. Path analysis, based on the Behavioral Model of Health Services Use, did not support the hypothesis that assignment to CTI reduces psychiatric re-hospitalization due to improvement in medication adherence. The third paper examines the impact of CTI and continuity of care on psychiatric re-hospitalization. The results from this study suggest that assignment to CTI, fewer changes in the number of psychiatrists and favorable patient perception of hospital discharge plans, were all significantly associated with a reduction in psychiatric re-hospitalization over the 18-month period. Furthermore, assignment to CTI was statistically associated with greater improvement in some indicators of continuity of care. In a path analysis controlling for various demographic variables, this study did not support the hypothesis that CTI reduces psychiatric re-hospitalization through improvement in continuity of care. Further study is needed to better understand the relationship between CTI and continuity of care in mental health services.

METHODS: Subjects recruited from a psychiatric emergency room and inpatient units were randomly assigned to one of the three treatment conditions: broker case management, in which the client's needs were assessed, services were purchased from multiple providers, and the client was monitored; assertive community treatment only, in which comprehensive services were provided for an unlimited period; and assertive community treatment augmented by support from community workers, who assisted with activities of daily living and were available for leisure activities. Of 165 subjects recruited, 135 were followed for 18 months. RESULTS: Compared with clients assigned to broker case management, clients assigned to assertive community treatment only and assertive community treatment with community workers had superior outcomes on several variables. They were number of contacts with the assigned treatment program, resource utilization (for example, use of entitlements), severity of thought disorder, activity level, and client satisfaction. Clients in the assertive community treatment only condition achieved more days in stable housing than those in the other two treatment conditions. No significant treatment group effects were found on income, self-esteem, or substance abuse. CONCLUSIONS: Assertive community treatment is superior to broker case management in assisting individuals with serious mental illness who are at risk of homelessness.","outcomes":["Health","Housing stability"],"city":"St Louis","status":"Completed","countryX":"United States","countryY":"United States","stateX":"Missouri","stateY":"Missouri","quality":"Low quality primary studies"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-90.19","38.63"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"E-371","type":"Effectiveness","studyDesign":"Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs)","studyType":"Impact evaluations","title":"Exiting homelessness without a voucher: A comparison of independently housed and other homeless veterans","year":"2011","url":"https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2011-07318-001","authors":"Tsai J ; Kasprow W ; Rosenheck R A;","interventionCategories":["Prevention","Services and outreach","Accommodation and accommodation-based services"],"populationGroups":["Veterans/Ex-services","People with/history of mental illness","People with alcohol/drug issues"],"abstract":"Studies that have shown the superiority of housing voucher programs over standard care for homeless adults with mental illness have also incidentally shown that many are able to obtain independent housing without subsidies.

However, LTBI treatment in homeless persons, a population at high-risk of active TB disease, is usually associated with poor adherence. We describe the impact of using directly observed treatment (DOT) versus self-administered treatments (SAT) as an adherence-improving intervention to administer four months of daily rifampin regimen for LTBI treatment among homeless adults in Atlanta. Retrospective analysis of clinical care data on 274 homeless persons who initiated daily rifampin treatment for LTBI treatment at a county health department between January 2014 and December 2016 was performed. To reduce bias from non-random assignment of treatment, an inverse probability of treatment weighted (IPTW) logistic regression model was used to assess the effect of treatment type on treatment completion. Subgroup analyses were performed to assess heterogeneity of treatment effect on LTBI completion. Of 274 LTBI treatment initiators, 177 (65%) completed treatment [DOT 118/181 (65%), SAT 59/93 (63%)]. In the fully adjusted and weighted analysis, the odds of completing LTBI treatment on DOT was 40% higher than the odds of completing treatment by SAT [adjusted odds ratio (95% CI), aOR: 1.40 (1.07, 1.82), p = 0.014]. The unstable nature of homeless persons' lifestyle makes LTBI treatment difficult for many reasons. Our study lends support to the use of DOT to improve LTBI treatment completion among subgroups of homeless persons on treatment with daily rifampin.","outcomes":["Health"],"city":"Atlanta","status":"Completed","countryX":"United States","countryY":"United States","stateX":"Georgia","stateY":"Georgia","quality":"Low quality primary studies"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-84.3902","33.7491"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"E-375","type":"Effectiveness","studyDesign":"Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs)","studyType":"Impact evaluations","title":"A mixed methods randomised control trial to evaluate the effectiveness of the journey to social inclusion - phase 2 intervention for chronically homeless adults: study protocol","year":"2019","url":"https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-01929774/full","authors":"Vallesi S ; Flatau P ; Thielking M ; Mackelprang J L; Taylor K M; Sala L L; Spiers J ; Wood L ; Martin K ; Kragt D ; Lester L ; Whittaker E ; Courtney R J;","interventionCategories":["Services and outreach","Accommodation and accommodation-based services"],"populationGroups":["Other"],"abstract":"BACKGROUND: Chronic homelessness is a problem characterised by longstanding inability to attain or maintain secure accommodation. Longitudinal research with homeless populations is challenging, and randomised controlled trials that evaluate the effectiveness of intensive, case management interventions aimed at improving housing and health‐related outcomes for chronically homelessness people are scant. More research is needed to inform programmatic design and policy frameworks in this area. This study protocol details an evaluation of the Journey to Social Inclusion ‐ Phase 2 program, an intervention designed to reduce homelessness and improve outcomes in chronically homeless adults. METHODS/DESIGN: J2SI Phase 2 is a three‐year, mixed methods, multi‐site, RCT that enrolled 186 participants aged 25 to 50 years between 07 January 2016 and 30 September 2016 in Melbourne. The intervention group (n = 90 recruited) receives the J2SI Phase 2 program, a trauma‐informed intervention that integrates intensive case management and service coordination; transition to housing and support to sustain tenancy; and support to build social connections, obtain employment and foster independence. The comparison group (n = 96 recruited) receives standard service provision. Prior to randomisation, participants completed a baseline survey. Follow‐up surveys will be completed every six months for three years (six in total). In addition to self‐report data on history of homelessness and housing, physical and mental health, substance use, quality of life, social connectedness and public service utilisation, linked administrative data on participants' public services utilisation (e.g., hospitalisation, justice system) will be obtained for the three‐year period pre‐ and post‐randomisation. Semi‐structured, qualitative interviews will be conducted with a randomly selected subset of participants and service providers at three time‐points to explore changes in key outcome variables and to examine individual experiences with the intervention and standard service provision. An economic evaluation of the intervention and associated costs will also be undertaken. DISCUSSION: Results of this trial will provide robust evidence on the effectiveness of J2SI Phase 2 compared to standard service provision. If the intervention demonstrates effectiveness in improving housing, health, quality‐of‐life, and other social outcomes, it may be considered for broader national and international dissemination to improve outcomes among chronically homeless adults.

The primary outcome was number of days rehoused, which was assessed by interviewing participants four times during a 9-month follow-up. Outcomes were analyzed with three-level mixed-effects models. The primary outcome did not differ between groups. CTI had a significant effect on family support and, for people experiencing less social support, psychological distress. Groups did not differ significantly on social support, fulfillment of care needs, quality of life, self-esteem, excessive alcohol use, or cannabis use. Because few participants were homeless at 9 months, more research is needed to establish whether CTI can prevent long-term recurrent homelessness.

This naturalistic, retrospective study describes an intervention (Transitional Supportive Housing and Case Management) that effectively promoted treatment admission for this high-risk group above and beyond that which could be explained by certain pretreatment factors. The clinical records of 211 military veterans referred to intensive outpatient addiction treatment were reviewed for factors related to treatment program admission, including 3 interventions designed to prevent waiting list attrition. Chi-square tests evaluated univariate predictors of treatment entry, and a hierarchical binary logistic regression evaluated several variables simultaneously. Results showed that fewer than 50% of wait-listed patients achieved treatment admission. Univariate predictors of treatment entry were not having a current partner, having a legal problem, and having had past substance use disorder treatment. The logistic regression showed that patients who received the intervention were 4.5 times more likely to enter the treatment program, and individuals with a current legal problem were 2.5 times more likely to enter treatment. Participation in a weekly support group and/or contact with a psychiatric nurse practitioner did not increase the likelihood of program admission. It may be possible to enhance treatment entry for the homeless and marginally housed by providing case management and housing services.

The differentiating effects of personal characteristics on the co-occurrence of substance use and social stability were also examined. Participants included 270 homeless youth and young adults who were randomly assigned to one of the three intervention conditions: CRA, n = 93, MET, n = 86, or CM, n = 91. Participants were assessed at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months postbaseline. A dual trajectory latent class growth analysis identified four co-occurring patterns: low-stable substance use paired with low-increasing social stability, high-stable substance use paired with low-stable social stability, high-declining substance use paired with low-increasing social stability, and low-increasing substance use paired with high-stable social stability. Findings showed that CRA was superior in improving substance use and social stability simultaneously compared to MET and CM, and further, CM was more effective than MET. Personal factors including race, age, coping strategies, and behavior problems differentiated the co-occurring patterns of substance use and social stability. The findings underscore the significance in identifying subgroups of homeless youth that vary in problem severity in terms of their substance use and social stability, and offer evidence to help practitioners identify the most effective intervention that responds to the needs of homeless youth.

Study design: Hypotheses tested included: a) completion of hepatitis A/B vaccination series; b) reduction in stimulant use; and c) reduction in number of sexual partners. Methods: A deconstructive cost analysis approach was utilized to capture direct costs associated with the delivery of both interventions. Based on an analysis of activity logs and staff interviews, specific activities and the time required to complete each were analyzed as follows: a) NCM + CM only; b) SE + CM only; c) time to administer/record vaccines; and d) time to receive and record CM visits. Cost comparison of the interventions included only staffing costs and direct cash expenditures. Results: The study outcomes showed significant over time reductions in all measures of drug use and multiple sex partners, compared to baseline, although no significant between-group differences were detected. Cost analysis favored the simpler SE + CM intervention over the more labor-intensive NCM + CM approach. Because of the high levels of staffing required for the NCM relative to SE, costs associated with it were significantly higher.

Most research has focused on adult homeless populations, yet youth have specific needs that require adapted interventions. This review aims to synthesize evidence on interventions for youth and assess their impacts on health, social, and equity outcomes. METHODS: We systematically searched Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, and other databases from inception until February 9, 2018 for systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials on youth interventions conducted in high income countries. We screened title and abstract and full text for inclusion, and data extraction were completed in duplicate, following the PRISMA-E (equity) review approach. RESULTS: Our search identified 11,936 records. Four systematic reviews and 18 articles on randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria. Many studies reported on interventions including individual and family therapies, skill-building, case management, and structural interventions. Cognitive behavioural therapy led to improvements in depression and substance use, and studies of three family-based therapies reported decreases in substance use. Housing first, a structural intervention, led to improvements in housing stability. Many interventions showed inconsistent results compared to services as usual or other interventions, but often led to improvements over time in both the intervention and comparison group. The equity analysis showed that equity variables were inconsistently measured, but there was data to suggest differential outcomes based upon gender and ethnicity. CONCLUSIONS: This review identified a variety of interventions for youth experiencing homelessness. Promising interventions include cognitive behavioural therapy for addressing depression, family-based therapy for substance use outcomes, and housing programs for housing stability. Youth pathways are often unique and thus prevention and treatment may benefit from a tailored and flexible approach.","outcomes":["Capabilities and Wellbeing","Employment and income","Health","Housing stability"],"city":"Los Angeles","status":"Completed","countryX":"United States","countryY":"United States","stateX":"California","stateY":"California","quality":"High quality reviews"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-118.2439","34.0544"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"I-2","type":"Implementation","studyDesign":"Implementation and Process Evaluation","studyType":"qualitative","title":"Project Safe Home Evaluation","year":"2010","url":"http://silbermanssw.org/ssw/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/PSH_Evaluation_Final_9_26_2011-1.pdf","authors":"Abramovitz M ;","interventionCategories":["Prevention","Services and outreach","Education and skills"],"populationGroups":["NA"],"abstract":" ","outcomes":["NA"],"city":"New York","status":"NA","countryX":"United States","countryY":"United States","stateX":"New York","stateY":"New York","quality":"Low"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-73.9808","40.7648"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"I-3","type":"Implementation","studyDesign":"Implementation and Process Evaluation","studyType":"qualitative","title":"Ending homelessness in Canada","year":"2016","url":"http://homelesshub.ca/resource/ending-homelessness-canada-study-10-year-plans-4-canadian-cities","authors":"Adamo A ; Klodawsky F ; Aubry T ; Hwang S ;","interventionCategories":["Legislation","Prevention","Services and outreach","Accommodation and accommodation-based services","Communication"],"populationGroups":["NA"],"abstract":"In 2012, with funding from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research (CIHR), the REACH3 network initiated a two-year study led by Dr. Stephen Hwang of the Centre for Urban Health Solutions (C-UHS) at St. Michael’s Hospital in Toronto.

Results demonstrate the perceived benefits of mindfulness on the parent-child relationship and have important implications for families at an increased risk of adverse outcomes. Because homelessness and residential instability confer considerable risk for young children, interventions to support effective parenting are critical.","outcomes":["NA"],"city":"Baltimore","status":"NA","countryX":"United States","countryY":"United States","stateX":"Maryland","stateY":"Maryland","quality":"Low"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-76.6108","39.2909"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"I-9","type":"Implementation","studyDesign":"Implementation and Process Evaluation","studyType":"qualitative","title":"Homeless youth's experiences with shelter and community care services: Differences between service types and the relationship to overall service quality","year":"2014","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019074091400317X","authors":"Altena A M; Beijersbergen M D; Wolf J R;","interventionCategories":["Services and outreach","Accommodation and accommodation-based services"],"populationGroups":["NA"],"abstract":"This study aimed to investigate the experiences of homeless youth with shelter and community care services, the association with the overall evaluation of service quality (overall evaluation score), and the way the experiences with particular service aspects were combined in the overall evaluation score.

Funded with savings generated through California’s Proposition 47, the CoCo LEAD Plus program is modeled after the LEAD program pioneered by King County, Washington. As such, CoCo LEAD Plus is designed to provide participants peer-driven outreach and engagement, evidence-based behavioral health services, wraparound work-readiness and vocational supports, and opportunities for transitional and permanent housing. By diverting people from further involvement in the justice system, CoCo LEAD Plus’s primary goal is to break the cycle of criminalization and repeated incarceration for people with behavioral health needs in Antioch. To achieve this, the county is institutionalizing a collaborative, multisystem approach to better address the root causes of behavioral health needs in order to help community members with such needs avoid justice-system involvement. As the primary grant recipient, the Contra Costa County Behavioral Health Division (BHD) has partnered with several local government agencies and community-based organizations to develop and implement the CoCo LEAD Plus program. BHD works closely with HealthRIGHT 360 (HR 360), the lead service provider, and APD staff to conduct the program’s daily operations.

This project targeted homeless individuals with diagnoses of severe mental illnesses. Three community behavioral health centers provided clinical supports for 122 clients across a five-year time frame (1997 – 2001). This research sought to address two questions. First, did participants show progress toward achieving program outcome goals? Second, could systematic predictors of improvement (or lack of improvement) be identified? The design of the program evaluation was that of time-series reflexive controls. This is analogous to a repeated measure design using hierarchical random regression. Assessments were completed by case managers each month and by trained evaluators each quarter. The assessment points for each client were fitted to a curve, and the growth trajectories were examined to determine program success as measured by the individuals’ rates of change (or slopes). Specifically three definitions of success were defined for interpretation of the slopes (rates of change). It was found that this program as implemented was successful in helping the homeless. Using the most stringent definition of success, the following results were found. Housing Stability was achieved for 84% of the clients. Management of psychiatric symptoms was achieved for 80% of the clients. Attainment of adult living skills was achieved for 73% of the clients. Socialization goals were met for 72% of the clients. Quality of life goals were met for 54% of the clients. Predictors of individual differences in growth trajectories were examined to determine their potential impact on the rate of change. Predictors included: demographic variables, baseline measure and length of stay, complexity and severity of illnesses, customer satisfaction, and compliance with treatment. The baseline measure (as represented by the intercept) was predictive of the growth rate across all measures. Substance abuse history was a significant correlate of housing instability. Modest correlations were found for other predictors. Recommendations are offered to improve the success of supportive housing programs, and for further research in this area.","outcomes":["NA"],"city":"Philadelphia","status":"NA","countryX":"United States","countryY":"United States","stateX":"Pennsylvania","stateY":"Pennsylvania","quality":"Low"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-75.1327","40.0115"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"I-43","type":"Implementation","studyDesign":"Implementation and Process Evaluation","studyType":"qualitative","title":"The Efficiency and Effectiveness of the Housing First Support Service Piloted by Depaul in Belfast, Funded by Supporting People: an SROI Evaluation","year":"2016","url":"https://www.nihe.gov.uk/housing_first_evaluation.pdf","authors":"Boyle D ; Palmer J ; Ahmen S ;","interventionCategories":["Accommodation and accommodation-based services"],"populationGroups":["NA"],"abstract":" ","outcomes":["NA"],"city":"Belfast","status":"NA","countryX":"United Kingdom","countryY":"United Kingdom","stateX":"Northern Ireland","stateY":"Northern Ireland","quality":"Low"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-5.9301","54.597"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"I-44","type":"Implementation","studyDesign":"Implementation and Process Evaluation","studyType":"qualitative","title":"Housing first in England: An evaluation of nine services","year":"2015","url":"https://www.york.ac.uk/media/chp/documents/2015/Housing%20First%20England%20Report%20February%202015.pdf","authors":"Bretherton J ; Pleace N ;","interventionCategories":["Accommodation and accommodation-based services"],"populationGroups":["NA"],"abstract":" ","outcomes":["NA"],"city":"London","status":"NA","countryX":"United Kingdom","countryY":"United Kingdom","stateX":"England","stateY":"","quality":"Low"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-0.1276","51.5073"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"I-45","type":"Implementation","studyDesign":"Implementation and Process Evaluation","studyType":"qualitative","title":"Evaluation of Homeless Services 2008 Series","year":"2008","url":"https://www.drugsandalcohol.ie/11721/1/homeless_agency_evaluation_of_services.pdf","authors":"Brooke S ; Courtney R ; Morris M ; Cassidy F ; Pillinger J ; Rhodes M L;","interventionCategories":["Services and outreach","Accommodation and accommodation-based services"],"populationGroups":["NA"],"abstract":" ","outcomes":["NA"],"city":"Dublin","status":"NA","countryX":"Ireland","countryY":"Ireland","stateX":"","stateY":"","quality":"Low"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-6.2848","53.3381"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"I-46","type":"Implementation","studyDesign":"Implementation and Process Evaluation","studyType":"qualitative","title":"In-Depth Evaluation of Camperdown Common Ground: Permanent housing for vulnerable long-term homeless people Final Report","year":"2015","url":"https://www.arts.unsw.edu.au/sites/default/files/documents/InDepth_Evaluation_of_Camperdown_Common_Ground_FINAL.pdf","authors":"Bullen J ; Whittaker E ; Root O ; Burns L ;","interventionCategories":["Accommodation and accommodation-based services"],"populationGroups":["NA"],"abstract":" ","outcomes":["NA"],"city":"Camperdown","status":"NA","countryX":"Australia","countryY":"Australia","stateX":"","stateY":"","quality":"Low"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["143.1466","-38.2319"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"I-47","type":"Implementation","studyDesign":"Implementation and Process Evaluation","studyType":"qualitative","title":"An Interim Evaluation of the Massachusetts Homelessness Prevention and Rapid Re-Housing Program","year":"2011","url":"http://as.tufts.edu/uep/sites/all/themes/asbase/assets/documents/fieldProjectReports/2011/Team_5_Final_Report.pdf","authors":"Burks S ; Gordon R ; Onubogu C ; Roberts B ; Sandoval S ;","interventionCategories":["Accommodation and accommodation-based services"],"populationGroups":["NA"],"abstract":" ","outcomes":["NA"],"city":"Boston","status":"NA","countryX":"United States","countryY":"United States","stateX":"Massachusets","stateY":"Massachusets","quality":"Low"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-71.063611","42.358056"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"I-48","type":"Implementation","studyDesign":"Implementation and Process Evaluation","studyType":"qualitative","title":"Review of Housing Support Products","year":"2018","url":"https://www.msd.govt.nz/documents/about-msd-and-our-work/publications-resources/evaluation/housing-support-products/review-of-housing-support-products.docx","authors":"Burmester B ;","interventionCategories":["Legislation"],"populationGroups":["NA"],"abstract":"Purpose This report outlines how the Ministry of Social Development’s (MSD) housing support products (HSPs) are being accessed by clients and reviewed and improved by MSD. The findings of this report contribute to a review of HSPs by MSD’s housing policy team. Findings and recommendations are based on research completed in August 2017 using standard MSD data and internal focus groups with Work and Income case managers who are the frontline staff, that use HSPs to support clients. Background HSPs are intended to help recipients meet the costs of moving into housing in the private rental market, or sustaining the tenancy of their existing housing. The original policy intent was that HSPs should only be considered after all other options available to the client to meet their particular needs have been exhausted. Research findings • HSPs are associated with moving out of public housing: 70 percent of HSP recipients who lived in public housing left it within one month of receiving HSPs. • HSPs may also help prevent recipients who are already in alternative housing from moving into public housing or onto the Social Housing Register: 96 percent of HSP recipients already living in alternative housing remained out of public housing one month after receiving HSPs. • Use of HSPs has been increasing since their launch in July 2014, with 66 percent of all HSPs being used in the 12 months to 30 June 2017. • HSPs are particularly helpful for some people, such as recipients who don’t qualify for other forms of assistance. HSP recipients tend to be female (77 percent), Māori (49 percent), single (44 percent), with children (44 percent), receiving a main benefit (67 percent), and not in public housing system or on the register (58 percent). • Bond Grant, Letting Fees Assistance and Rent in Advance are the most commonly used HSPs, the least expensive (of those HSPs with monetary costs), and commonly administered together as a package. • Tenancy Costs Cover is least commonly used and may discourage landlords from letting to MSD recipients by implying a likelihood of damage to their property. • Level of uptake of HSPs is consistent with policy intent but also reflects other factors. Case managers use HSPs only after exploring other options first, however they also identified other complications they encounter when using HSPs such as complex eligibility criteria and perceived administrative barriers.","outcomes":["NA"],"city":"Wellington","status":"NA","countryX":"New Zealand","countryY":"New Zealand","stateX":"","stateY":"","quality":"Medium"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["174.7772","-41.2889"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"I-49","type":"Implementation","studyDesign":"Implementation and Process Evaluation","studyType":"qualitative","title":"Rapid Re-Housing for Homeless Families Demonstration Programs Evaluation Report Part II: How They Worked-Process Evaluation","year":"2016","url":"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3055269","authors":"Burt M ; Wilkins C ; Spellman B ; D'Alanno T ; White M ; Henry M ; Matthews N ;","interventionCategories":["Accommodation and accommodation-based services"],"populationGroups":["NA"],"abstract":"Rapid re-housing is a homeless assistance strategy that provides homeless families with immediate, temporary assistance to help them return to permanent housing and to promote their housing and economic stability.

In 1995, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) implemented the Continuum of Care approach to streamline the existing competitive funding and grant-making process under the McKinney-V ento Homeless Assistance Act and to encourage communities to coordinate more fully the planning and provision of housing and services for homeless people. In 2000, HUD contracted with the Urban Institute and its subcontractor, ICF Consulting, Inc., to conduct an assessment of the Continuum of Care approach. This study examined 25 Continuums of Care in all regions of the country .At the outset of the study, the Department was unsure whether the Continuum of Care concept had achieved detectable results in fostering a coordinated response to homelessness. For this reason, the study intentionally identified communities to study that appeared to have been successful in implementing a Continuum of Care. Because they had been able to convey a sense of progress in meeting their goals, these communities also happened to receive more than a typical share of funding under HUD's competitive allocation process. Among these high performers, the study sought to ensure that the study communities were broadly representative geographically, but the sites cannot be taken as representative of all of the communities that are operating HUD-assisted homeless programs.","outcomes":["NA"],"city":"Boston","status":"NA","countryX":"United States","countryY":"United States","stateX":"Massachusets","stateY":"Massachusets","quality":"Medium"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-71.063611","42.358056"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"I-52","type":"Implementation","studyDesign":"Implementation and Process Evaluation","studyType":"qualitative","title":"Widening Effects of the Corporation for Supportive Housing’s System-Change Efforts in Los Angeles, 2005–2008","year":"2009","url":"http://webarchive.urban.org/publications/411864.html","authors":"Burt M R;","interventionCategories":["Services and outreach"],"populationGroups":["NA"],"abstract":" ","outcomes":["NA"],"city":"Los Angeles","status":"NA","countryX":"United States","countryY":"United States","stateX":"California","stateY":"California","quality":"Low"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-118.2439","34.0544"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"I-54","type":"Implementation","studyDesign":"Implementation and Process Evaluation","studyType":"qualitative","title":"THE SKID ROW COLLABORATIVE—2003–2007 PROCESS EVALUATION","year":"2007","url":"https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/46721/411546-The-Skid-Row-Collaborative--.PDF","authors":"Burt MR ;","interventionCategories":["Accommodation and accommodation-based services"],"populationGroups":["NA"],"abstract":" ","outcomes":["NA"],"city":"Washington DC","status":"NA","countryX":"United States","countryY":"United States","stateX":"Washington","stateY":"Washington","quality":"Low"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-77.0366","38.895"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"I-55","type":"Implementation","studyDesign":"Implementation and Process Evaluation","studyType":"qualitative","title":"Housing First Europe: Final Report","year":"2013","url":"http://www.habitat.hu/files/FinalReportHousingFirstEurope.pdf","authors":"Busch-Geertsema V ;","interventionCategories":["Accommodation and accommodation-based services"],"populationGroups":["NA"],"abstract":" ","outcomes":["NA"],"city":"Copenhagen","status":"NA","countryX":"Denmark","countryY":"Denmark","stateX":"","stateY":"","quality":"Low"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["12.5689","55.6761"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"I-56","type":"Implementation","studyDesign":"Implementation and Process Evaluation","studyType":"qualitative","title":"Rehousing homeless people-the case of Soziale Wohnraumhilfe Hannover: a basic analytical evaluation and a follow-up-study of tenants and ex-tenants","year":"2002","url":"https://www.ssoar.info/ssoar/bitstream/handle/document/33955/ssoar-2002-busch-geertsema-Rehousing_homeless_people_-_the.pdf?sequence=1","authors":"Busch-Geertsema V ;","interventionCategories":["Accommodation and accommodation-based services"],"populationGroups":["NA"],"abstract":" ","outcomes":["NA"],"city":"Tampa","status":"NA","countryX":"United States","countryY":"United States","stateX":"Florida","stateY":"Florida","quality":"Low"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-82.4584","27.9478"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"I-57","type":"Implementation","studyDesign":"Implementation and Process Evaluation","studyType":"qualitative","title":"An Evaluation of An Assessment of Check-In/Check-Out with Children who are Homeless in an After School Care Program","year":"2016","url":"http://scholarcommons.usf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=7394&context=etd","authors":"Camacho A P;","interventionCategories":["Services and outreach","Education and skills"],"populationGroups":["NA"],"abstract":" ","outcomes":["NA"],"city":"Tampa","status":"NA","countryX":"United States","countryY":"United States","stateX":"Florida","stateY":"Florida","quality":"Low"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-82.4584","27.9478"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"I-58","type":"Implementation","studyDesign":"Implementation and Process Evaluation","studyType":"qualitative","title":"Evaluating the Housing First Approach in the Metro Vancouver Region","year":"2017","url":"http://www.gvss.ca/PDF-2014/REPORT_Evaluating%20the%20Housing%20First%20Approach%20in%20the%20Metro%20Vancouver%20Region.pdf","authors":"Canham S ;

This includes additional resources to address the issue—especially for drop-in centers, crisis services and shelters, and transitional and supportive housing programs. There has also been an increase in broader City investments to address homelessness overall in recent years—ranging from outreach, to eviction prevention, to supportive housing units and low-income housing assistance—some of which has benefited youth. Yet the assessment also found critical gaps in youth-specific resources in the following areas: • prevention and early intervention supports, • long-term and affordable housing options, • mental health services, • education and career development supports, and • aftercare services and supports that extend beyond program exits.","outcomes":["NA"],"city":"New York","status":"NA","countryX":"United States","countryY":"United States","stateX":"New York","stateY":"New York","quality":"Low"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-73.9808","40.7648"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"I-61","type":"Implementation","studyDesign":"Implementation and Process Evaluation","studyType":"qualitative","title":"Evaluation of Enhanced Housing Options Trailblazers programme: Final report","year":"2011","url":"https://www.cchpr.landecon.cam.ac.uk/Projects/Start-Year/2009/Evaluation-of-Enhanced-Housing-Options-Trailblazers/Final-Report","authors":"Clarke A ; Grant L F; Markkanen S ; Monk S ; Whitehead C ;","interventionCategories":["Services and outreach"],"populationGroups":["NA"],"abstract":"The Enhanced Housing Options Trailblazers were being run by DCLG with support from the DWP.

The evaluation: assembled robust evidence on the process issues associated with setting up enhancements to existing services, as proposed by the trailblazers; measured the success of the programmes in achieving core objectives (meeting housing need with a wider range of solutions; using stock more effectively; tackling worklessness; and improving customer service); tracked the immediate and longer term outcomes for the different client groups who approach the service; explored the costs of running the service and the additional net cost savings that the service can generate; identified lessons learnt, leading to the development of a good practice toolkit as part of a series of measures to enable the housing options approach and to encourage the development of enhanced housing options services by other local authorities.","outcomes":["NA"],"city":"Cambridge","status":"NA","countryX":"United Kingdom","countryY":"United States","stateX":"England","stateY":"Massachusets","quality":"Low"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["0.1249","52.2033"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"I-62","type":"Implementation","studyDesign":"Implementation and Process Evaluation","studyType":"qualitative","title":"‘Making Safe’: a coordinated community response to empowering victims and tackling perpetrators of domestic violence","year":"2013","url":"https://doi.org/10.1017/S147474641200070X","authors":"Clarke A ; Wydall S ;","interventionCategories":["Health and social care"],"populationGroups":["NA"],"abstract":"This article describes an exploratory study of the Making Safe Scheme, which is a multiagency initiative designed to provide a coordinated and integrated response to domestic violence by focusing on both victims and perpetrators.

Design/methodology/approach – The author reviewed the intended outcomes of the original guidance and then looked at a range of data from evaluations of current PIE services in UK and Ireland. Findings – The findings were that the PIE approach is effective in meeting the outcomes suggested by the original guidance; in reducing social exclusion and improving the mental health of homeless people; and in improving staff morale and interactions. Research limitations/implications – This is a practice-based evidence. There needs to be more practice-based evidence gathered, and it would be useful if there were some standardised measures, as long as these did not limit the richness of the data which suggests that PIEs have a wide, not narrow, impact. Practical implications – The implications are that homelessness services should use the PIE approach, and that they should be supported by clinically trained psychotherapists or psychologists; and that wider mental health services should look at the PIE approach in terms of working effectively with socially excluded people with complex needs/mental health problems. Social implications – PIEs are an effective way of working with socially excluded people with mental health problems/complex needs, enabling the reduction of social exclusion among this very excluded client group. Originality/value – This is the first review of evidence, much of it so far unpublished, for the effectiveness of PIEs, despite the fact that this approach has been increasingly adopted by both providers and commissioners in the homelessness sector.","outcomes":["NA"],"city":"Guildford","status":"NA","countryX":"United Kingdom","countryY":"United Kingdom","stateX":"","stateY":"","quality":"Low"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-0.5654","51.2353"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"I-64","type":"Implementation","studyDesign":"Implementation and Process Evaluation","studyType":"qualitative","title":"‘Something to Smile About’: An evaluation of a capacity-building oral health intervention for staff working with homeless people","year":"2013","url":"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0017896912437291","authors":"Coles E ;

Part of the Obama Administration’s plan to end veteran homelessness by 2016, VHPD was one of the first homelessness prevention programs to exclusively serve homeless and at-risk veterans and their families. VHPD provided short- to medium-term housing assistance (up to 18 months), including security deposits, rent, rental arrearages (up to 6 months back rent), moving cost assistance, and utilities; case management; and referrals to community-based services and supports. Service providers could also use VHPD funds for childcare, credit repair, and transportation expenses. In addition to providing these supports, VHPD intended to connect veterans to needed health services through the VA’s healthcare system and employment services through local workforce agencies, so the program could provide veterans with a more comprehensive set of supports and better prepare them to sustain housing on their own.","outcomes":["NA"],"city":"San Diego","status":"NA","countryX":"United States","countryY":"United States","stateX":"California","stateY":"California","quality":"Low"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-117.1628","32.7174"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"I-73","type":"Implementation","studyDesign":"Implementation and Process Evaluation","studyType":"qualitative","title":"Prevention programs funded by the Homelessness Prevention and Rapid Re-Housing Program","year":"2015","url":"https://www.huduser.gov/portal/publications/affhsg/HPRP-homeless-prevention-report.html","authors":"Cunningham M ; Burt M R; Scott M ; Locke G ; Buron L ; Klerman J ; Stillman L ;","interventionCategories":["Services and outreach","Accommodation and accommodation-based services"],"populationGroups":["NA"],"abstract":"Launched in 2009 to help American families survive a deep recession, the Homelessness Prevention and Rapid Re-housing Program (HPRP) enabled the first ever large-scale implementation of homelessness prevention programs. HPRP distributed $1.5 billion in grant funding to 535 states, counties, cities, and U.S. territories, and approximately 2,500 other entities, mostly direct service providers, were subgrantees. As of September 30, 2011 (2 years into the 3-year program), HPRP had provided 909,192 people in 359,192 households with financial assistance and supportive services designed to prevent homelessness. The Homelessness Prevention Study (HPS) documented the first 2 years of HPRP homelessness prevention. It included a nationally representative survey of HPRP grantees and subgrantees, analysis of HUD-required Annual Performance Report data, and 17 indepth case studies of local prevention programs.1 The communities chosen for case studies represent a range of approaches to homelessness prevention, as well as geographic diversity and a variety of special target populations. This report on the HPS combines a national-level overview of HPRP with insight into community-level implementation and challenges of HPRP-funded prevention programs and develops implications for research and policy development in homelessness prevention.","outcomes":["NA"],"city":"Washington DC","status":"NA","countryX":"United States","countryY":"United States","stateX":"Washington","stateY":"Washington","quality":"Medium"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-77.0366","38.895"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"I-74","type":"Implementation","studyDesign":"Implementation and Process Evaluation","studyType":"qualitative","title":"The Community College and the Homeless: A Model for the Nation.

Unlike their peers, these youth typically must make the transition without financial or other support from parents. As a result, many who age out of foster care find themselves homeless or precariously housed. One resource for such youth is the Family Unification Program (FUP). FUP is a special-purpose voucher program under the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD’s) Housing Choice Voucher (HCV, also known as Section 8) program. The primary purpose of FUP is to provide housing vouchers to child-welfareinvolved families for whom the lack of adequate housing is the primary reason for imminent out-of-home placement of children or delays in family reunification. Youth ages 18 to 21 who leave foster care at age 16 or older and who do not have adequate housing, however, are also eligible for a time-limited housing voucher. FUP vouchers offer up to 18 months of rental subsidy and supportive services to help such youth gain skills for independent living. FUP functions as an interagency collaboration between local public housing agencies (PHAs) and public child welfare agencies (PCWAs). Participating communities decide whether to apply for FUP vouchers, and, if awarded vouchers, whether to serve families, youth, or both in their FUP programs. In communities using FUP for youth, PCWAs refer eligible youth to PHAs and offer supportive services to those who receive a FUP voucher. When PHAs receive youth referrals, they verify HCV eligibility and subsidize the rent of eligible youth who are able to find and secure housing. This report describes the extent to which—and how—communities are using FUP to support youth. The research draws on findings from a survey of PHAs administering FUP, a survey of PCWAs partnered with PHAs that serve youth, and site visits to four areas that use FUP to serve youth. The surveys were designed to identify the universe of communities providing FUP vouchers to youth and to gather basic information about how they administer the program. The site visits sought to provide a finer grained understanding of how communities are using FUP to serve this population and sought to identify promising practices and lessons learned. The surveys and site visits were conducted as part of a larger study undertaken by Mathematica Policy Research and Chapin Hall on housing options for youth who are aging out of foster care. The larger study included a review of the relevant literature on housing for youth aging out of foster care, developed an inventory of state and local housing programs for this population, and identified several potentially innovative features of non-FUP programs that merit additional attention (Dworsky et al., 2012). Other study activities included a forum focused on current research in this area and its policy implications","outcomes":["NA"],"city":"Tampa","status":"NA","countryX":"United States","countryY":"United States","stateX":"Florida","stateY":"Florida","quality":"Low"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-82.4584","27.9478"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"I-89","type":"Implementation","studyDesign":"Implementation and Process Evaluation","studyType":"qualitative","title":"Phase 2 report from the payment by results Social Impact Bond pilot at HMP Peterborough","year":"2014","url":"https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR473.html","authors":"Disley E ; Rubin J ;","interventionCategories":["Financing"],"populationGroups":["NA"],"abstract":"In 2010 the world’s first Social Impact Bond (SIB) was launched at Peterborough Prison, sponsored by the Ministry of Justice and the Big Lottery Fund. A SIB is a form of payment by results1 where funding is raised from private, non-government investors and used to pay for interventions to improve social outcomes. If these interventions are effective, this could result in savings to Government and wider benefits to society. As part of a SIB the Government agrees to pay a proportion of these savings back to the investors as a return on their investment. If the outcomes do not improve, investors lose their investment. The Peterborough payment by results pilot uses a SIB to fund interventions to reduce reoffending among male offenders released from HMP Peterborough having served short prison sentences (less than 12 months). The pilot is coordinated by Social Finance, a notfor-profit financial intermediary, who obtained investment funding from private individuals, trusts and foundations to finance the pilot. This investment is used to fund an intervention called the One Service. This is a voluntary scheme offering through the gate support to reduce reoffending, meaning that contact is made with prisoners before release and continued in the community. The One Service is delivered by a mix of paid caseworkers and volunteers. There is no fixed intervention model or single theory of change articulated for the One Service. It was described by stakeholders as taking a pragmatic and client-led approach, in which the mix of activities for each offender is determined by caseworkers according to individual need. The intervention model has been modified during the pilot, for example by commissioning new providers, to ensure offenders’ needs are met. If the One Service is successful in reducing reconvictions the Ministry of Justice, supported by the Big Lottery Fund, will repay investors their capital and a return on their investment.","outcomes":["NA"],"city":"Peterborough","status":"NA","countryX":"United Kingdom","countryY":"United Kingdom","stateX":"England","stateY":"England","quality":"Low"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-0.2417","52.5739"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"I-90","type":"Implementation","studyDesign":"Implementation and Process Evaluation","studyType":"qualitative","title":"The Right Home Project","year":"2017","url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/600949/The_Right_Home_Project_report_March_2017.pdf","authors":"Dixon J ; Lee J Ward,W;","interventionCategories":["Services and outreach","Accommodation and accommodation-based services"],"populationGroups":["NA"],"abstract":" ","outcomes":["NA"],"city":"York","status":"NA","countryX":"United Kingdom","countryY":"United Kingdom","stateX":"England","stateY":"England","quality":"Medium"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-1.0815","53.9591"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"I-91","type":"Implementation","studyDesign":"Implementation and Process Evaluation","studyType":"qualitative","title":"Making a house a home: The House Project evaluation.

It is important to acknowledge that The Orange Door is one of many critical reforms currently underway in Victoria and that this is a time of immense change in the family violence and family and child wellbeing service systems. Other critical reforms that are currently being implemented in Victoria include the introduction of the Family Violence Information Sharing; the Child Information Sharing Scheme; Roadmap for Reform: strong families, safe children; Free from violence – Victoria’s prevention strategy; initiatives as part of Building from Strength: 10-year industry plan for family violence prevention and response; rollout of the Specialist Family Violence Courts model; and The Family Violence Risk Assessment and Risk Management Framework (MARAM). The scale of change associated with the reforms and the dynamic nature of reform implementation are important in understanding the establishment and initial operations of The Orange Door in the first four areas. The Orange Door plays a pivotal role in shifting from the existing models that have been identified by the Royal Commission into Family Violence as not meeting the needs of families and victims of family violence, towards linked up, integrated responses to family violence and children and family wellbeing concerns. To this end, the importance of The Orange Door to the overall reforms cannot be underestimated – nor can the significant change management for services, their workforces and the broader service system – required for Victoria to reach this vision. The magnitude of Family Safety Victoria’s (FSV) task to progress a new service delivery model and establish four new integrated services, secure accommodation and contract partner agencies in 9 to 12 months, while establishing its own agency at the same time, was an enormous undertaking. We note that the Royal Commission recommended introduction of the Support and Safety Hubs by 1 July 2018 (recommendation 37), which placed pressure on FSV to establish The Orange Door areas quickly after its own establishment in July 2017.","outcomes":["NA"],"city":"Melbourne","status":"NA","countryX":"Australia","countryY":"Australia","stateX":"","stateY":"","quality":"Medium"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["144.9632","-37.8142"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"I-104","type":"Implementation","studyDesign":"Implementation and Process Evaluation","studyType":"qualitative","title":"Evaluation of an occupational therapy intervention service within homeless services in Bristol","year":"2011","url":"https://www2.uwe.ac.uk/faculties/HLS/ahp/AHP%20Documents/Places-for-people-OTIS-report-Oct2011.pdf","authors":"Fieldhouse J ; Parmenter V ; Peregrine D ; Barham R ;","interventionCategories":["Services and outreach","Education and skills"],"populationGroups":["NA"],"abstract":"This report has three overarching aims: 1. To evaluate the OTIS’ contribution to service delivery in emergency accommodation and the supported housing sector generally. 2. To identify how occupational therapy practice could potentially inform the ongoing work of staff within the supported housing sector. 3. To examine cultural issues within the supported housing sector from the perspective of OT practice and propose alternative ways of working. Part One was drafted by Dave Peregrine (Scheme Manager at Redwood House) and incorporated material provided by Ruth Barham (OTIS practitioner). It provides an account of the service start-up and delivery, and reflects on the service in the light of its stated aims. Part Two was written by Jon Fieldhouse and Vanessa Parmenter – Senior Occupational Therapy Lecturers from the University of the West of England (UWE) – in October 2011. Vanessa and Jon, along with Alice Hortop, provided professional supervision to the OTIS and worked in partnership with PfP prior to and during service delivery. This section provides an OT professional insight into the issues raised in Part One and summarises what was learned – aiming to inform potential future OT input within Bristol’s supported housing sector. The two parts of this report were written separately with only limited opportunities for PfP and UWE to confer, due to Dave and Ruth’s departure from their PfP posts in August 2011. The report was therefore compiled and formatted by Jon Fieldhouse and Vanessa Parmenter.","outcomes":["NA"],"city":"Bristol","status":"NA","countryX":"United Kingdom","countryY":"United Kingdom","stateX":"England","stateY":"England","quality":"Low"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-2.5974","51.4535"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"I-105","type":"Implementation","studyDesign":"Implementation and Process Evaluation","studyType":"qualitative","title":"Evaluating homelessness prevention in Newcastle","year":"2011","url":"https://www.newcastle.gov.uk/sites/default/files/wwwfileroot/housing/evaluating_homelessness_prevention_in_newcastle_2011_full_report.pdf","authors":"Fitzpatrick S ; Harding J ; Irving A ; Pawson H ; Sosenko F ;","interventionCategories":["Services and outreach"],"populationGroups":["NA"],"abstract":" ","outcomes":["NA"],"city":"Newcastle","status":"NA","countryX":"United Kingdom","countryY":"United Kingdom","stateX":"England","stateY":"","quality":"Medium"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-1.6578","55.0077"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"I-106","type":"Implementation","studyDesign":"Implementation and Process Evaluation","studyType":"qualitative","title":"FINAL EVALUATION OF THE ROUGH SLEEPERS INITIATIVE","year":"2005","url":"http://docs.scie-socialcareonline.org.uk/fulltext/rough_sleepers.pdf","authors":"Fitzpatrick S ; Pleace N ; Bevan M ;","interventionCategories":["Legislation"],"populationGroups":["NA"],"abstract":"An evaluation of the Rough Sleepers Initiative (RSI) programme was undertaken by the Centre for Housing Policy, at the University of York, during the Autumn of 2004 and the Spring of 2005.

At the time of writing the strategy, the housing market was suffering from the effects of the housing market crash of 2008. In the private sector, the turnover of properties for sale was at a very low level and house prices were falling with demand for rented accommodation increasing. The strategy recognised the need to be pragmatic and realistic in its aims and objectives whilst acknowledging that there had been much needed gains in housing quality across all tenures over the last decade or so. The strategy aimed to consolidate and build on these advances despite the economic climate and recognised that there was still much that needed to be done and partnership working would be essential in resolving many of the housing challenges. Despite these challenging circumstances, Glasgow’s Housing Strategy 2011-2016 was aspirational and ambitious with a vision of delivering better quality homes across all tenures and improving access to housing and housing services for Glasgow’s people. It is with this background that Glasgow’s Housing Strategy 2011-2016 developed three key interlinked strategic themes which provided the framework for this monitoring and evaluation report.","outcomes":["NA"],"city":"Glasgow","status":"NA","countryX":"United Kingdom","countryY":"United Kingdom","stateX":"Scotland","stateY":"Scotland","quality":"Low"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-4.2436","55.8567"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"I-120","type":"Implementation","studyDesign":"Implementation and Process Evaluation","studyType":"qualitative","title":"National Final Report Cross-Site At Home/Chez Soi Project","year":"2014","url":"https://www.mentalhealthcommission.ca/sites/default/files/mhcc_at_home_report_national_cross-site_eng_2_0.pdf","authors":"Goering p ;","interventionCategories":["Accommodation and accommodation-based services","Health and social care"],"populationGroups":["NA"],"abstract":" ","outcomes":["NA"],"city":"Vancouver","status":"NA","countryX":"Canada","countryY":"Canada","stateX":"","stateY":"","quality":"Medium"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-123.1139","49.2609"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"I-121","type":"Implementation","studyDesign":"Implementation and Process Evaluation","studyType":"qualitative","title":"Evaluation of the Sharing Solutions programme","year":"2015","url":"http://shura.shu.ac.uk/11307/1/eval-sharing-solutions-programme.pdf","authors":"Green S ;

Veterans with evidence of homelessness (henceforth “homeless”) were identified through VHA administrative records. PCMH-SHEP survey respondents included 67,666 veterans with MHSUDs (9.2% homeless).

Homeless veterans had elevated rates of most MHSUDs assessed, indicating significant cooccurrence. After controlling for these differences, homeless veterans reported more negative and fewer positive experiences with communication; more negative provider ratings; and more negative experiences with comprehensiveness, care coordination, medication decision-making, and self-management support than nonhomeless veterans.

Results: Overall, only 8 percent of the more than 65,000 eligible veterans contacted by outreach workers were referred to the program. Those referred were more likely to be female, to have more sources of income, to have recently used VA services (including residential treatment), and to have serious mental health problems.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the changes experienced by homeless TB patients, and to discuss the possible role of PHC-based DOTS treatment in effecting these changes. DESIGN: A qualitative study via in-depth interviews with 18 ex-homeless patients who completed DOTS-based treatment at Shinjuku City PHC. The data were analysed using the interpretive content analysis method. RESULTS: The various changes experienced by the participants were categorised into five sub-categories of empowerment, including improved mental health and interpersonal relationships. Some of these changes were attributable to the participants undergoing PHC-based DOTS, which, by addressing their various emotional needs, helped to trigger patient empowerment. Based on our findings, a model of empowerment using PHC-based DOTS was constructed. CONCLUSION: PHC-based DOTS not only successfully controlled TB, it also empowered homeless patients by addressing their emotional needs. The interpersonal skills of the nurses played a critical role in this process.

Mean scores at the tailored non-VA site were superior to those from the 3 mainstream VA sites (P < .001).

The study draws on data from in-depth qualitative interviews with participants from the Toronto, Ontario site of the 'At Home/Chez Soi' Project. DESIGN: In-depth interviews were conducted with a subsample of participants from a larger Housing First randomised controlled trial. SETTING: The research took place in Toronto, Canada.

We describe early results of the Medical Home for Homeless Children Project, whose nurse care coordinators work with homeless families to conduct standardized nursing assessments that include evidence-based screening for child mental health and behavioral disorders with referral and case management for mental and behavioral health services.

Moreover, few examples exist of programs that integrate outreach, screening, referral to appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic services, and care coordination. We describe early results of the Medical Home for Homeless Children Project, whose nurse care coordinators work with homeless families to conduct standardized nursing assessments that include evidence-based screening for child mental health and behavioral disorders with referral and case management for mental and behavioral health services. Screening identified a group of children with mental health issues that warranted referral, and many of those referrals were successfully completed.","outcomes":["NA"],"city":"Jacksonville","status":"NA","countryX":"United States","countryY":"United States","stateX":"Florida","stateY":"Florida","quality":"Low"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-81.6557","30.3322"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"I-174","type":"Implementation","studyDesign":"Implementation and Process Evaluation","studyType":"qualitative","title":"Ending rough sleeping: what works?","year":"2017","url":"https://www.crisis.org.uk/media/238368/ending_rough_sleeping_what_works_2017.pdf","authors":"Mackie P ; Johnsen S ; Wood J ;","interventionCategories":["Services and outreach","Accommodation and accommodation-based services"],"populationGroups":["NA"],"abstract":" ","outcomes":["NA"],"city":"Cardiff","status":"NA","countryX":"United Kingdom","countryY":"United Kingdom","stateX":"Wales","stateY":"Wales","quality":"Low"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-3.1792","51.4817"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"I-175","type":"Implementation","studyDesign":"Implementation and Process Evaluation","studyType":"qualitative","title":"Homelessness Prevention and the Welsh Legal Duty: Lessons for International Policies","year":"2015","url":"https://search.proquest.com/docview/1682694116?accountid=149134","authors":"Mackie P K;","interventionCategories":["Legislation","Prevention"],"populationGroups":["NA"],"abstract":"The paradigm shift in international homelessness policies towards a prevention focus has resulted in proven benefits to society and most importantly to individuals at risk of homelessness.

The research method involved interviews with social workers and coordinators of homelessness care programs, analysis of policy documents and observations of intake conversations. The following issues are discussed: (1) conditionality in regular homelessness care; (2) conditionality in organisations that are directly accessible; (3) counterproductive dynamics of residual care; and (4) invisibility of those labelled as “care avoiders”.

The closure process involved an extended period of active outreach that facilitated access to housing, substance use treatment, and other services to people who stayed in the encampments and faced displacement. We examined two primary outcomes: first, whether the encampments were closed as scheduled and remained closed; and, second, the extent to which the people who were sleeping in the encampments (i.e., the target population) received needed services. The evaluation is based upon five primary data collection activities that, combined, provided a timely, multifaceted assessment of ERP, and particularly of the impacts ERP had on both those displaced by the initiative and the area of Kensington surrounding these encampments. These data components are: 1. An “Outreach Encampment and Survey” of 169 persons who frequented the encampments; 2. Data collected as part of ERP outreach services and linked to the City of Philadelphia’s integrated data system of services records known as CARES; 3. Direct observation of community meetings, ERP planning meetings, and encampment sites; 4. Interviews with people who stayed in encampments and community members as well as advocates for those staying in the encampments, and ERP officials and providers; and 5. Documents and records from City of Philadelphia and other sources, and media coverage related to ERP and Kensington. The ERP involved three phases: planning, implementation, and sustainment. The planning phase spanned early 2018, corresponding with the growth of the encampments and area concerns. During this initial phase, the encampment resolution group, consisting of leadership from multiple City departments, completed a plan for closing the Kensington Avenue and Tulip Street encampments. Two encampments were targeted so that sufficient housing would be available for the estimated 90 persons regularly sleeping in these locations. The plan highlighted the exceptional nature of the situation in Kensington, providing an opportunity to innovate and promote novel approaches to aiding those staying in encampments and improving the quality of life in the area around the encampments. It also underscored the heroic dimension to the initiative, in which modest resources were pitted against the daunting problems of homelessness and opioid abuse that were particularly intertwined and concentrated in the Kensington area. ERP started on April 30 with a 30-day implementation period where on-demand, low barrier housing and substance use treatment were offered to the target population in advance of the encampment closures. We assessed the implementation phase using a six-pronged approach: (1) findings from the Outreach Encampment Survey, which demonstrated the characteristics and needs of those staying in the encampments; (2) cataloging available services, and the extent to which they were appropriate, in sufficient supply, and accessible to the target population; (3) monitoring service engagement and its impact; (4) collecting perspectives from people staying in the encampments; (5) collecting perspectives from individuals advocating on behalf of those staying in the encampments and community members; and (6) documenting the encampment clearance process. When the implementation phase ended on May 30 with the closure of the two encampments, 83 individuals had engaged in temporary housing or substance use treatment services. After the encampments were cleared, the sustainment phase commenced and stretched well into Fall 2018. Our monitoring of this period focused on the longer-term outcomes of those who had engaged in services through ERP and the impact that the encampment clearances had on the surrounding area. 6 There were three facets to this monitoring. First, we took an in-depth look at the use of data, both ad hoc records used by outreach workers to structure sustained engagement, and administrative records covering a range of City-based services provided both before and after the ERP initiative. This allowed us to assess changes in services use as well as housing and treatment outcomes four and a half months after the encampments closed. In addition, we examined perspectives and reflections on the ERP from those who engaged with ERP-related services and from those involved in providing services, offering onthe-ground views of the sustainment process as well as early assessments of what worked and how future initiatives could be improved. Finally, we explored how the encampment closures impacted the surrounding community and, specifically, what changed in the wake of the closures, both near the former encampment locations and, more generally, in terms of impacts on homelessness and substance use in the area. This report offers the most comprehensive examination of an encampment clearance process, including the outcomes of those who were displaced by the clearances and the impact on the community, of which we are aware. Integrating an array of quantitative and qualitative data, we distill the key findings from this evaluation into 22 “lessons learned.” These are presented by the phase by which they are most readily associated: the planning phase (3 lessons), the implementation phase (9 lessons), and the sustainment phase (10 lessons).","outcomes":["NA"],"city":"New York","status":"NA","countryX":"United States","countryY":"United States","stateX":"New York","stateY":"New York","quality":"Medium"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-73.9808","40.7648"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"I-192","type":"Implementation","studyDesign":"Implementation and Process Evaluation","studyType":"qualitative","title":"Falling Through the Cracks: How the Community-Based Approach Has Failed Calgary's Chronically Homeless","year":"2018","url":"https://journalhosting.ucalgary.ca/index.php/sppp/article/view/43397/31011","authors":"Milaney K ; Williams N ; Dutton D ;","interventionCategories":["Accommodation and accommodation-based services","Health and social care"],"populationGroups":["NA"],"abstract":" ","outcomes":["NA"],"city":"Calgary","status":"NA","countryX":"Canada","countryY":"Canada","stateX":"","stateY":"","quality":"Low"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-114.0626","51.0531"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"I-193","type":"Implementation","studyDesign":"Implementation and Process Evaluation","studyType":"qualitative","title":"STRIVE Education","year":"2018","url":"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/733025/Strive_Evaluation_2018.pdf","authors":"Ministry of Housing; Communities ; Local Government ; London ;","interventionCategories":["Education and skills"],"populationGroups":["NA"],"abstract":" ","outcomes":["NA"],"city":"London","status":"NA","countryX":"United Kingdom","countryY":"United Kingdom","stateX":"England","stateY":"","quality":"Low"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-0.1276","51.5073"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"I-194","type":"Implementation","studyDesign":"Implementation and Process Evaluation","studyType":"qualitative","title":"Enhancing a public health nursing shelter program","year":"2017","url":"http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=cookie,ip,shib&db=rzh&AN=126113466&site=ehost-live","authors":"Minnich M ; Shirley N ;","interventionCategories":["Health and social care"],"populationGroups":["NA"],"abstract":"The Shelter Nurse Program offers important nursing care and resources that help meet the health needs of the homeless population and improve the health of homeless individuals and families.

HUDVASH, a collaboration between the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Department of Veterans Affairs, has grown from a small program serving fewer than 2,000 Veterans in 2008 to a major program with the capacity to serve more than 87,000 Veterans in 2017. With 87,864 VASH vouchers in circulation in April 2017, the program contributed substantially to the 47-percent decline in the number of homeless Veterans since 2010. The HUD-VASH exit study takes a close look at how the HUD-VASH program was implemented in four different sites, focusing most on the 2011-to-2014 period, supplemented with administrative data covering 2008 to 2014. HUD-VASH served more than 7,000 clients during this time at the four sites. Researchers surveyed more than 500 Veterans and conducted indepth interviews with 110 Veterans to enhance information that could be derived from administrative data. The study analyzes how Veterans moved through the program from homelessness to stable housing and why Veterans exit the program. By better understanding why Veterans leave the program, we can inform and improve efforts to house this population. The report finds that about one-half of Veterans who exited the program during the observation period simply no longer needed its intensive support, but a substantial minority of exiters would probably benefit from continued case management services and housing assistance—the key program features. This need is especially strong among Veterans who exit the program before accessing housing. The report describes program successes and offers concrete recommendations for program improvement. In particular, it describes promising practices for serving the Veterans with the greatest barriers to housing stability. This careful analysis of the characteristics of exiters from the program should inspire current and future efforts to better address the needs of the homeless veteran population.","outcomes":["NA"],"city":"Washington DC","status":"NA","countryX":"United States","countryY":"United States","stateX":"Washington","stateY":"Washington","quality":"Low"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-77.0366","38.895"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"I-198","type":"Implementation","studyDesign":"Implementation and Process Evaluation","studyType":"qualitative","title":"Evaluation of Housing First England: A report for Homeless Link","year":"2019","url":"https://hfe.homeless.org.uk/sites/default/files/attachments/Housing%20First%20England%20project%20evaluation_%20March%202019.pdf","authors":"Moreton R ; Welford J ; Robinson S ; Richards S ;","interventionCategories":["Accommodation and accommodation-based services"],"populationGroups":["NA"],"abstract":"Homeless Link commissioned CFE Research to conduct an evaluation of their Housing First England project.

Brisbane Common Ground has been funded to target tenants who: • Have low to moderate incomes, with a focus on people who are working and have connection to the local area; • Have experienced chronic homelessness (which a focus on people who have been or are currently rough sleepers) who will benefit from coordinated service delivery and 24/7 security and support. Brisbane Common Ground is referred to as a flagship initiative under the National Partnership Agreement on Homelessness (Queensland Government 2012). The model of supportive housing sits within the policy context and agenda set out in the Commonwealth Government (2008) White Paper on Homelessness: The Road Home: A National Approach to Reducing Homelessness. The White Paper outlined a vision for offering supported accommodation to all rough sleepers who ‘need’ it by 2020.

Contemporary research shows that people with both health and social problems are able to exit homelessness and sustain housing over several years. Although the existing evidence is robust and often based on studies employing rigorous experimental designs, clients of programs are presented as passive service recipients whose exits from homelessness are attributed to outside intervention. Drawing on a multisite Australian study with people who had exited chronic and unsheltered homelessness, this article adopts a theoretical framework of human agency to demonstrate how people exiting homelessness play active roles in shaping the outcomes they achieve. Extending the existing evidence base, we show how they explain their outcomes in terms of imagined future trajectories and an evaluation of their options to achieve change.","outcomes":["NA"],"city":"Brisbane","status":"NA","countryX":"United States","countryY":"Australia","stateX":"","stateY":"","quality":"Low"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-122.4","37.6808"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"I-213","type":"Implementation","studyDesign":"Implementation and Process Evaluation","studyType":"qualitative","title":"Qualitative Evaluation of the London Homelessness Social Impact Bond (SIB)_Final Report","year":"2017","url":"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/658921/Qualitative_Evaluation_of_the_London_Homelessness_SIB.pdf","authors":"Paul M ; Richard L ; Fleur N ;","interventionCategories":["Financing"],"populationGroups":["NA"],"abstract":" ","outcomes":["NA"],"city":"Marsham","status":"NA","countryX":"United Kingdom","countryY":"United Kingdom","stateX":"England","stateY":"England","quality":"Low"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["1.2528","52.769"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"I-214","type":"Implementation","studyDesign":"Implementation and Process Evaluation","studyType":"qualitative","title":"Evaluation of an Integrated Cluster Care and Supportive Housing Model for Unstably Housed Persons Using the Shelter System","year":"2016","url":"http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=cookie,ip,shib&db=rzh&AN=112088516&site=ehost-live","authors":"Pauley T ; Gargaro J ; Falode A ; Beben N ; Sikharulidze L ; Mekinda B ;","interventionCategories":["Services and outreach"],"populationGroups":["NA"],"abstract":" ","outcomes":["NA"],"city":"Toronto","status":"NA","countryX":"Canada","countryY":"Canada","stateX":"","stateY":"","quality":"Low"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-79.3849","43.6529"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"I-215","type":"Implementation","studyDesign":"Implementation and Process Evaluation","studyType":"qualitative","title":"Evaluation of Homelessness Prevention Activities in Scotland","year":"2007","url":"https://www.gov.scot/Publications/2007/03/26095144/0","authors":"Pawson H ; Davidson E ; Netto G ;","interventionCategories":["Services and outreach"],"populationGroups":["NA"],"abstract":" ","outcomes":["NA"],"city":"Edinburgh","status":"NA","countryX":"United Kingdom","countryY":"United Kingdom","stateX":"Scotland","stateY":"Scotland","quality":"Medium"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-85.9667","39.3542"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"I-216","type":"Implementation","studyDesign":"Implementation and Process Evaluation","studyType":"qualitative","title":"Evaluating homelessness prevention","year":"2007","url":"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120919175331/http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/housing/pdf/573347.pdf","authors":"Pawson H ; Netto G ; Jones C ; Wager F ; Fancy C ; Lomax D ;","interventionCategories":["Services and outreach"],"populationGroups":["NA"],"abstract":" ","outcomes":["NA"],"city":"Edinburgh","status":"NA","countryX":"United Kingdom","countryY":"United Kingdom","stateX":"Scotland","stateY":"Scotland","quality":"Low"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-85.9667","39.3542"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"I-217","type":"Implementation","studyDesign":"Implementation and Process Evaluation","studyType":"qualitative","title":"A vacation for the homeless: evaluating a collaborative community respite programme in Canada through clients' perspectives","year":"2013","url":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23057696/","authors":"Perreault M ; Jaimes A ; Rabouin D ; White N D; Milton D ;","interventionCategories":["Education and skills"],"populationGroups":["NA"],"abstract":"This study assesses the Urban Breakaway Project, a collaborative project offering a structured vacation in the countryside of the province of Quebec intended for homeless (or street) youths.

The aim of the study was to better understand how receiving housing prior to treatment impacts engagement and envisioned recovery for previously homeless individuals with mental illness. Method: Semistructured interviews were conducted with recently housed participants within the five research sites (N = 27). An analysis of early findings was performed, and themes were identified using the constant comparative method. Results: Most participants reported that housing represents an early step in rebuilding identity, which enabled them to envision a different future. A subgroup experienced demoralization related to personal challenges, and expressed concerns about adjustment issues and social isolation. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: By providing choice regarding housing, Housing First facilitates a sense of personhood, which is essential to recovery. However, some recently housed individuals with complex needs may require additional supports to address early adjustment issues.","outcomes":["NA"],"city":"Montreal","status":"NA","countryX":"Canada","countryY":"Canada","stateX":"","stateY":"","quality":"Medium"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-73.554","45.5088"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"I-226","type":"Implementation","studyDesign":"Implementation and Process Evaluation","studyType":"qualitative","title":"The Inspiring Change Manchester Housing First Pilot:Final Evaluation Report","year":"2018","url":"https://pure.york.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/the-inspiring-change-manchester-housing-first-pilot(4cfdda83-1b79-42a4-b50f-90a7653f9b9b).html","authors":"Quilgars D ; Pleace N ;","interventionCategories":["Accommodation and accommodation-based services"],"populationGroups":["NA"],"abstract":" ","outcomes":["NA"],"city":"Manchester","status":"NA","countryX":"United Kingdom","countryY":"United States","stateX":"England","stateY":"England","quality":"Low"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-2.2441","53.4791"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"I-227","type":"Implementation","studyDesign":"Implementation and Process Evaluation","studyType":"qualitative","title":"HUD Section 811 PRA Project Rental Assistance Program Process Evaluation","year":"2018","url":"https://www.huduser.gov/portal/sites/default/files/pdf/section-811-processeval-report.pdf","authors":"Randal P ; Christopher J ; Kenya C ; Jie D ; BCT Partners ;","interventionCategories":["Accommodation and accommodation-based services"],"populationGroups":["NA"],"abstract":" ","outcomes":["NA"],"city":"Los Angeles","status":"NA","countryX":"United States","countryY":"United States","stateX":"California","stateY":"California","quality":"Low"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-118.2439","34.0544"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"I-228","type":"Implementation","studyDesign":"Implementation and Process Evaluation","studyType":"qualitative","title":"Engaging with Newcomer Youth Experiencing","year":"2018","url":"http://homelesshub.ca/sites/default/files/Ch2-3-MentalHealthBook.pdf","authors":"Ratnam Cheyanne ; Fitzpatrick Ann ; Thang Helen ;","interventionCategories":["Communication"],"populationGroups":["NA"],"abstract":" ","outcomes":["NA"],"city":"Toronto","status":"NA","countryX":"Canada","countryY":"Canada","stateX":"","stateY":"","quality":"Low"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-79.3849","43.6529"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"I-229","type":"Implementation","studyDesign":"Implementation and Process Evaluation","studyType":"qualitative","title":"Evaluation of the “Report Card on Ending Homelessness in Ottawa”","year":"2012","url":"http://homelesshub.ca/sites/default/files/Phase%201%20Ottawa%20Report%20Cards%20of%20Ending%20Homelessness%20Retroactive%20Evaluation%202004-2011.pdf","authors":"Rattelade S ; Farrell S ; Aubry T ; Klodawsky F ;","interventionCategories":["Services and outreach"],"populationGroups":["NA"],"abstract":" ","outcomes":["NA"],"city":"Ottawa","status":"NA","countryX":"Canada","countryY":"Canada","stateX":"","stateY":"","quality":"Low"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-75.69","45.421"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"I-230","type":"Implementation","studyDesign":"Implementation and Process Evaluation","studyType":"qualitative","title":"Housing options in Scotland: A thematic enquiry","year":"2014","url":"https://www.scottishhousingregulator.gov.uk/publications/housing-options-scotland-thematic-inquiry","authors":"Regulator Scottish Housing;","interventionCategories":["Legislation"],"populationGroups":["NA"],"abstract":"We explore how local authorities deliver Housing Options and it's effectiveness in preventing and alleviating homelessness.","outcomes":["NA"],"city":"Edinburgh","status":"NA","countryX":"United States","countryY":"United Kingdom","stateX":"Scotland","stateY":"Scotland","quality":"High"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-85.9667","39.3542"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"I-231","type":"Implementation","studyDesign":"Implementation and Process Evaluation","studyType":"qualitative","title":"Evaluation of the Trailblazers Homelessness Prevention Pilot","year":"2019","url":"https://data.essex.gov.uk/dataset/e6k4p/evaluation-of-the-trailblazers-homelessness-prevention-pilot","authors":"Research Citizen insight;","interventionCategories":["Prevention"],"populationGroups":["NA"],"abstract":"The Trailblazers pilot funded ten specialist mentors to support people at risk of homelessness across Greater Essex, working in all its 12 districts/boroughs and two Unitary Authorities.

The pilot aimed to deliver prevention activity earlier and work with a wider group of people – not just those who are owed the main homelessness duty – with a focus on complex and vulnerable groups, through: • Collaborating with other services to identify at-risk households and target interventions well before they are threatened with eviction; • Helping people 56 days or even earlier when they are threatened with the loss of their home; • Offering that help to a wider group of people than just those owed the main homelessness duty; and • Testing new, innovative approaches to preventing homelessness Mentors had specialist knowledge of homelessness support and prevention and sub- specialisms in supporting vulnerable groups (e.g. young people and people with significant multiple disadvantage). They coordinated a varied package of support for those at risk of homelessness, to address their holistic needs, and provide support and mentorship to those providing this support, to increase their skills and capacity.

These sites, along with nine comparison sites, also received funds to support outreach and assertive community treatment programs to assist 100 clients a year at each site. Outcome data were obtained at baseline and three and 12 months later from 7,055 clients across four annual cohorts at all sites.

It argues that careful appraisal of the way in which enforcement is actually implemented ‘on the ground’ revealed that the situation is rather more complex and less punitive than it may at first appear. It demonstrates that the use of enforcement measures, when accompanied by appropriate support can, in fact, lead to beneficial outcomes for some individuals involved in begging or street drinking in some situations. The outcomes for other members of the street population can, however, be very negative and are highly unpredictable, such that the use of enforcement, even when accompanied by intensive support, is always a high risk strategy","outcomes":["NA"],"city":"York","status":"NA","countryX":"United Kingdom","countryY":"United Kingdom","stateX":"England","stateY":"England","quality":"Low"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-1.0815","53.9591"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"I-239","type":"Implementation","studyDesign":"Implementation and Process Evaluation","studyType":"qualitative","title":"Community Collaboration for Housing Homeless Families: Results from the Field","year":"2004","url":"http://homelesshub.ca/resource/community-collaboration-housing-homeless-families-results-field","authors":"Schiff J W;","interventionCategories":["Services and outreach","Accommodation and accommodation-based services"],"populationGroups":["NA"],"abstract":"Describes a Calgary emergency shelter program involving collaboration among various community partners & designed to house total families.

According to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), there were over 554,000 Americans experiencing homelessness in 2017. Of this population, approximately 192,875 people were unsheltered. And though overall homelessness has declined nationally since 2008, unsheltered homelessness is on the rise. In all, HUD estimates that 2 million people experience homelessness at some point in any given year. Despite the national decreasing trend in homelessness, California remains on the front lines of the crisis. On any given night in California in 2018, 129,972 people are homeless. Of these, 52,765 are residents of Los Angeles County. First-time homelessness in Los Angeles County is increasing: In 2018, 9,205 Angelenos experienced homelessness for the first time, an increase in the annual incidence of first-time homelessness by 1,161 persons. Structural causes such as inadequate wages and a constrained supply of affordable housing exacerbate the This project evaluates the county’s current homelessness prevention efforts spearheaded by the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority (LAHSA), called the Prevention and Diversion Program.","outcomes":["NA"],"city":"Los Angeles","status":"NA","countryX":"United States","countryY":"United States","stateX":"California","stateY":"California","quality":"Low"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-118.2439","34.0544"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"I-241","type":"Implementation","studyDesign":"Implementation and Process Evaluation","studyType":"qualitative","title":"Housing people who are homeless in Glasgow","year":"2018","url":"https://www.scottishhousingregulator.gov.uk/sites/default/files/publications/Housing%20people%20who%20are%20homeless%20in%20Glasgow%20-%2029%20March%202018%20-%20FINAL_0.pdf","authors":"Scottish Housing Regulator;","interventionCategories":["Accommodation and accommodation-based services"],"populationGroups":["NA"],"abstract":" ","outcomes":["NA"],"city":"Glasgow","status":"NA","countryX":"United Kingdom","countryY":"United Kingdom","stateX":"Scotland","stateY":"Scotland","quality":"Low"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["-4.2436","55.8567"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"I-242","type":"Implementation","studyDesign":"Implementation and Process Evaluation","studyType":"qualitative","title":"Evaluation of Homelessness Prevention Innovation Fund Projects","year":"2008","url":"https://www.nls.uk/scotgov/2008/0068587.pdf","authors":"Sharp C ; Robertson L ;","interventionCategories":["Services and outreach"],"populationGroups":["NA"],"abstract":"The Homelessness Prevention Innovation Fund (HPIF) was announced as part of the Statement on the Abolition of Priority Need to the Scottish Parliament on December 21, 2005.

Brisbane Common Ground is a model of supportive housing comprising 146 units (135 studio and 11 one bedroom units) in a fourteen story building located in South Brisbane. The building also has onsite offices for both the support provider and the tenancy manager. Brisbane Common Ground aims to assist tenants sustain housing, improve their quality of life – health, social and economic, and reduce their utilisation of acute, crisis and emergency services (Queensland Government 2012). Brisbane Common Ground has been funded to target tenants who: • Have low to moderate incomes, with a focus on people who are working and have connection to the local area; • Have experienced chronic homelessness (which a focus on people who have been or are currently rough sleepers) who will benefit from coordinated service delivery and 24/7 security and support. Brisbane Common Ground is referred to as a flagship initiative under the National Partnership Agreement on Homelessness (Queensland Government 2012). The model of supportive housing sits within the policy context and agenda set out in the Commonwealth Government (2008) White Paper on Homelessness: The Road Home: A National Approach to Reducing Homelessness. The White Paper outlined a vision for offering supported accommodation to all rough sleepers who ‘need’ it by 2020. Central to the policy aim is the provision of programs offering integrated support to people with high and complex needs; these include innovative housing models that offer secure housing and wrap around support (Australian Government 2008).

Auckland City Mission estimates that there are approximately 100-150 people sleeping rough in the Auckland Central Business District (Auckland City Mission, 2009). Around 70 per cent of these rough-sleeping clients are Māori. Since many homeless people live in public spaces, this is their home and the place in which they drink, urinate, and socialise. Poverty means that many homeless people undertake activities such as begging, to buy food, pay for shelter, and to support their alcohol and drug-related problems. Their behaviour and actions are more likely to draw the attention of law enforcement agencies (Midgley 2005). Walsh (2004), for example, found that the offences most commonly committed by homeless people included public order offences, such as begging, public nuisance, and trespass associated with squatting, and drug-related offences. The cycle of homelessness was linked to the cycle of offending. The international literature suggests too, that people experiencing homelessness often fail to appear in court. Many are not in a position to fight the procedural or substantive issues a case presents. They are also aware, for example, that traditional courts require a decent appearance and not wanting to make a bad first impression, some homeless people with poor hygiene or without a place to store their belongings, choose not to appear in court at all. Moreover they may be reluctant to attend court due to the uncertainty of court proceedings and the possible threat of custody. When they do appear, the traditional courts are ill-equipped to deal with the issues of homelessness, as the defendants are unable to obtain bail as they have no address to be bailed to and may fail to receive court correspondence due to having no permanent address (Midgley, 2005). Mental health and other disabilities, alcohol and other drug abuse, poor literacy, and limited resources can also contribute to a situation where legal issues compound, further entrenching them in homelessness. These unresolved legal issues and the threat of custody then continue to present barriers to homeless people accessing the services they require, such as employment, housing and treatment programmes. There is a prevalent feeling that the system does not work in their interests (Forell, McCarron and Scetzer, 2005). TKTH is not unique. Internationally, homeless courts have been established to divert people away from the criminal justice system and link people to appropriate services and supports. The philosophy of these courts mirrors that of drug and mental health courts, in that they apply the principles of therapeutic jurisprudence. Literature looking at best practice responses to chronic public space offending by those who are homeless and who have co-morbid complex mental health and/or addiction needs, has found that that neither a law enforcement, nor a rehabilitative approach on its own is successful in addressing the low-level, repeat offending by homeless people. In other jurisdictions, a solutions-focused approach, combining both law enforcement and rehabilitative measures, has been formalised through the establishment of special purpose or special circumstance courts. These courts adopt a case-management approach to dealing with chronically-homeless offenders, bringing together the 10 agencies responsible for managing the legal and rehabilitative responses to offending under one coordinated management plan, and incorporating the offender’s views. Evaluations have shown this approach to be more effective in dealing with the underlying issues of homelessness, giving a much greater opportunity for reducing future offending","outcomes":["NA"],"city":"Auckland","status":"NA","countryX":"Australia","countryY":"Australia","stateX":"","stateY":"","quality":"Medium"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["174.74","-36.840556"]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"unique_id":"I-276","type":"Implementation","studyDesign":"Implementation and Process Evaluation","studyType":"qualitative","title":"A Home of Your Own","year":"2017","url":"https://ysaatio.fi/en/housing-first-finland/a-home-of-your-own-handbook","authors":"Y-Foundation ;","interventionCategories":["Accommodation and accommodation-based services"],"populationGroups":["NA"],"abstract":"Finland is the only country in Europe where the number of homeless people is on the decline. This is not a coincidence. Since the 1980s, the state, volunteers, municipalities and NGOs have been working with determination to reduce homelessness. Of particular importance is that in the 2000s, the state has launched and funded programmes aimed at reducing homelessness, which have in particular tackled the situation of the most vulnerable long-term homeless. With the help of the programmes, organisations and municipalities have, for example, provided new housing for the homeless and reformed the services aimed at them. All of these actors have wanted the same thing: to humanise the life of the homeless. The state’s firm guidance turned reducing homelessness into a shared goal. The process went on despite the economic recession that began in 2008, during which cuts were made to many other services provided by society. First and foremost, however, it all required a complete reversal in how homelessness was thought about: the whole system was built on the basis of the Housing First principle. Above all, Housing First is a principle. It is also an operating model, an ideology and a way of thinking. The Housing First principle is guided by the notion that having a place to live is both a human right and a basic right. All the work done for homeless people starts from the assumption that the first support measure should be the provision of housing. The work can be organised using different models and by providing different kinds of housing, but housing is always the top priority. As recently as the 1980s, a homeless person in Finland could only get a home once they had demonstrated their social acceptability. Often this meant abstaining from intoxicants. As a result, a homeless person would end up going round in circles with a permanent dwelling being nothing but a distant dream. In the Housing First model, a dwelling is not a reward that a homeless person receives once their life is back on track. Instead, a dwelling is the foundation on which the rest of life is put back together. When a person has a roof securely over their head it is easier for them to focus on solving their other problems. This shift in thinking particularly changed the lives of those long-term homeless people who had been in the most difficult position of all. This group includes people recovering from substance abuse and mental health issues, for example. Applying the model has reinforced the idea that they too can manage in a regular rental apartment if they receive the right kind of support. For one person, a lease and safe apartment of their own is enough support, whereas another may also need various support measures in daily life. Housing naturally cannot be provided unless apartments exist. It has been important for the implementation of the model that more affordable housing has come on the market. Constructing and purchasing new, affordable housing was one of the most important goals of the Finnish National Programme to reduce long-term homelessness","outcomes":["NA"],"city":"Helsinki","status":"NA","countryX":"Finland","countryY":"Finland","stateX":"","stateY":"","quality":"Low"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":["24.9486","60.1733"]}}]}
